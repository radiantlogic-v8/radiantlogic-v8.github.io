The status values are: new, new(manual), moved, correlated, correlated(manual), already correlated, ignored, or error. Below is a description of each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>New - Indicates a new identity that is pushed into the global profile.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New(manual) – Indicates that the entry was manually added as a new identity in the global profile list by an administrator using the Global Identity Builder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moved – This status is not seen during uploads. It is only applicable for events related to real-time persistent cache refresh of the global profile list. For LDAP identity sources, if a capture connector detects a <code class=\"language-text\">move</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">modRDN</code> operation on an entry, the persistent cache refresh connector scans the global profile list and updates the VDDN attribute for the relevant identity, to match the moved entry's new DN/location.

An example of a common error is one indicating that there was a disconnection to the identity data source.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">entryDn</code> column is the full DN of the identity source entry that was processed.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">vuid</code> column contains the unique identifier for the entry inside the global profile.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">filter</code> column indicates the last filter that was evaluated by the correlation engine.

If it is <strong>N/A</strong> then the entry was already correlated, ignored or an error occurred.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">ruleNumber</code> column indicates the correlation rule number that was used to correlate the entry.
