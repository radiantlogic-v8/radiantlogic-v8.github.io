The first uploaded source should represent the most authoritative list of identities because it establishes the baseline reference by which identities uploaded from subsequent data sources are compared against. Be mindful of the different combinations of identity linking that can occur based on the conditions in your correlation rules and upload order because it can result in identities not getting linked properly, creating duplicate identities in the global profile view or ending up as <a href=\"#unresolved-identity\">unresolved</a>.</p>\n<p>Consider the example shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image42.png\" alt=\"Sample – Identity Correlation\"></p>\n<p>Sample – Identity Correlation</p>\n<p>Assume the upload order is 1) LDAP Directory, 2) Active Directory, 3) HR Database. The LDAP directory populates the <code class=\"language-text\">title</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">login</code> attributes into the global profile. The rules to correlate Active Directory entries involves the <code class=\"language-text\">login</code> attribute and this data source contributes <code class=\"language-text\">mail</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">employeeID</code> into the global profile as depicted below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image43.png\" alt=\"Sample - LDAP and Active Directory Correlation Rules\"></p>\n<p>Sample - LDAP and Active Directory Correlation Rules</p>\n<p>The last identity source to upload is the HR database and the rules to correlate HR entries involves the <code class=\"language-text\">login</code> attribute or the <code class=\"language-text\">employeeID</code> attribute as depicted below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image44.png\" alt=\"Sample - Database Identity Source Rules\"></p>\n<p>Sample - Database Identity Source Rules</p>\n<p>Now consider if the upload order was different and the HR Database was uploaded before Active Directory. Since one of my correlation rules indicates when <code class=\"language-text\">login</code> (in the Global Profile) matches <code class=\"language-text\">LOGIN</code> (in the HR database), this is the same physical person, the John Smith user from the HR database would not be automatically linked to the John Smith user in the global profile. In this case, the attribute to dictate the proper link (<code class=\"language-text\">employeeNumber</code> in global profile = <code class=\"language-text\">EID</code> in HR database) would only be populated after the identities from Active Directory were uploaded into the global profile. So John Smith from the HR database would either go into <a href=\"#unresolved-identity\">unresolved</a>, or if you selected the option to <strong>Create a new identity when there is no match</strong> when you configured the correlation rules for the HR database, another identity for John Smith would be created in the global profile. Either of these scenarios would require human intervention to fix, to either manually link the accounts or remove the duplicate account from the global profile.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nIf you need to correlate overlapping users from the same source, and this source is the one you are uploading first, be sure to disable the <a href=\"#_Skip_Correlation_on\"><strong>Skip Correlation on First Source Upload</strong></a> option.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To upload identities into the global profile, from the project page, select <strong>Upload/Sync</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image9.png\" alt=\"Uploading Identities into the Global Profile\"></p>\n<p>Uploading Identities into the Global Profile</p>\n<p>There are two sections visible on the upload step.
