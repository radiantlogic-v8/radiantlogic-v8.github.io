Even if a user is listed in only one store (unless that exact store is already known), an application still needs to locate them, resulting in multiple queries issued (at least one to each source the user could potentially be located in). However, if you have a master index (an \"identity hub\"), the application only needs to query this list to locate a user, which results in queries to only the backend stores where the user is located. The more sources involved, the more valuable this global index is. It is this global list that is created and maintained by RadiantOne.</p>\n<p>In cases where the data stores contain user overlap, the RadiantOne service performs aggregation and correlation, creating a common key to identify users across disparate systems. However, the union operation is still important for data sources that may or may not have identity intersection. If they do not have identity overlap there is no need for correlation, but the function of union is still crucial for building your identity service.</p>\n<p>The diagrams below provide a summary/review of data sources containing duplicate/intersecting identities.</p>\n<p>In the first scenario, the data sources have no overlap of identities. In this scenario the benefits of union would still be important for identity management since a single unique index/list is still required for applications to identify a user for authentication. However, the design effort is a bit easier as no correlation logic is required. An aggregation of sources A, B, and C is sufficient, so the primary design consideration in this case is what hierarchy applications are expecting and to build this namespace accordingly.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1100px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 30.545454545454547%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Data Sources with No Overlapping Identities\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/70c589e4122b3d98740032f5c408bea2/28a3f/image2.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/70c589e4122b3d98740032f5c408bea2/88b8e/image2.png 275w,\n/static/70c589e4122b3d98740032f5c408bea2/8c3ad/image2.png 550w,\n/static/70c589e4122b3d98740032f5c408bea2/28a3f/image2.png 1100w,\n/static/70c589e4122b3d98740032f5c408bea2/77e4e/image2.png 1530w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>In cases where there starts to be user overlap (as seen in Sources A and B in the diagram below), the configuration starts to require correlation.

To learn about these, please read <a href=\"concepts.md\">Global Identity Builder concepts</a>.</p>\n<p>The creation of a Global Identity Builder project is a process that involves multiple steps. To learn about these steps, please read the section on <a href=\"create-projects/create-project.md\">creating projects</a>.</p>\n<p>Manual interventions are often required in a Global Identity Builder project. To learn about these manual tasks, please read the section on <a href=\"identity-administration.md\">manual identity administration</a>.</p>\n<p>After a Global Identity Builder project has been created, it must be kept up to date. To learn how to perform this maintenance, please read the section on <a href=\"manage-persistent-cache/overview.md\">managing real-time persistent cache refresh</a>.</p>\n<p>Authorization and personalization is commonly enforced using LDAP. In a Global Identity Builder project, this functionality is retained by remapping existing LDAP directories to the <a href=\"concepts.md#global-profile\">global profile</a>. To learn how this is done, please read the section on <a href=\"link-groups/overview.md\">linking existing groups to global profile identities</a>.</p>\n<p>An Azure AD of your choosing can be specified as the data source for a Global Identity Builder project. To learn how to do this, please read the section on <a href=\"integrate-configure-data-source.md\">integrating and configuring a custom data source</a>.</p>\n<p>A Global Identity Builder project may encounter issues related LDAP dynamic groups, nested groups, and users/groups in multiple containers. Read this section to learn how to <a href=\"address-group-challenges/ldap-dynamic-groups.md\">address group membership challenges</a>.</p>\n<p>Certain optional configurations can be added to a Global Identity Builder project by using the <a href=\"concepts.md#global-identity-viewer\">Global Identity Viewer</a>. To learn about how to enable these configurations, read the section on <a href=\"global-profile-view.md\">extending the global profile view</a>.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"introduction-to-global-identity-builder"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Introduction to Global Identity Builder"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you do not have a single source of users, an application would have to look in all the different data stores across the enterprise to find a particular user.
