href=\"#appendix-c-extending-the-global-profile-view\">72</a>](#appendix-c-extending-the-global-profile-view)</p>\n<h1 id=\"chapter-1-introduction\">Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>\n<p>If you don't have a single source of users, an application would have to look in all the different data stores across the enterprise to find a particular user. Even if a user is listed in only one store (unless that exact store is already known), an application still needs to locate them, resulting in multiple queries issued (at least one to each source the user could potentially be located in). However, if you have a master index (an \"identity hub\"), the application only needs to query this list to locate a user, which results in queries to only the backend stores where the user is located. The more sources involved, the more valuable this global index is. It is this global list that is created and maintained by RadiantOne.</p>\n<p>In cases where the data stores contain user overlap, the RadiantOne service performs aggregation and correlation, creating a common key to identify users across disparate systems. However, the union operation is still important for data sources that may or may not have identity intersection. If they do not have identity overlap there is no need for correlation, but the function of union is still crucial for building your identity service.</p>\n<p>The diagrams below provide a summary/review of data sources containing duplicate/intersecting identities.</p>\n<p>In the first scenario, the data sources have no overlap of identities. In this scenario the benefits of union would still be important for identity management since a single unique index/list is still required for applications to identify a user for authentication. However, the design effort is a bit easier as no correlation logic is required. An aggregation of sources A, B, and C is sufficient, so the primary design consideration in this case is what hierarchy applications are expecting and to build this namespace accordingly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1.: Data Sources with No Overlapping Identities</p>\n<p>In cases where there starts to be user overlap (as seen in Sources A and B in the diagram below), the configuration starts to require correlation. In this scenario, an aggregation of users from sources A, B and C is required in addition to correlation for the overlapping users in sources A and B. The design considerations now involve correlation logic in addition to where you want the unique list of users to appear in the virtual namespace.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image3.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1.: Data Sources with No Overlapping Identities</p>\n<p>In scenarios where the number of data sources increases, the amount of overlapping identities varies (as depicted in the diagram below), and the logic required to correlate identities becomes complex with the possible need of cascading rules to determine correlation, the RadiantOne Identity Data Analysis tool analyzes the quality of data in the backends, helping you determine which attributes would be the best candidates for correlation rules. The data analysis tool generates a report for each of your data sources. These reports give you a glimpse of your existing data and provide insight on the quality of your data and what is available for you to use for correlation logic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image4.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1.: Complex Identity Integration Scenario</p>\n<p>It is recommended that you use the Data Analysis tool on your data prior to using the Global Identity Builder tool.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE - If you have identities in cloud directories/applications or other data sources being accessed through a custom API, you must use RadiantOne to virtualize and persistent cache them prior to using the Global Identity Builder tool. For details on this process, please see <a href=\"#appendix-a-integrating-a-custom-data-source\">Appendix A</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you have a list of your identity sources and ideas about how to correlate overlapping identities, you are ready to use the Global Identity Builder tool to create your global profile view/reference list.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – The virtual view created by the Global Identity Builder is read-only since it is an aggregation/computation of identities and attributes from a variety of heterogeneous data sources. The <a href=\"#global-identity-viewer\">Global Identity Viewer</a> tool can be used to search/browse the global profile view and offers edit-ability of attributes on the tabs representing the backend data source(s).</p>\n<p>The purpose of this guide is to describe how to use the Global Identity Builder tool accessible from the Wizards tab in the RadiantOne Main Control Panel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accessing-the-global-identity-builder-tool\">Accessing the Global Identity Builder Tool</h2>\n<p>The Global Identity Builder tool is accessible from the Wizards tab in the RadiantOne Main Control Panel.</p>\n<p>Any user that is a member of the RadiantOne Directory Administrator role, or the Namespace Admin role can access the tool. For details on the RadiantOne delegated admin roles, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n<p>To access the Global Identity Builder tool, navigate in a web browser to the Main Control Panel associated with the RadiantOne leader node.</p>\n<p>http://&#x3C;hostname>:7070/main/login</p>\n<p>Examples include the following.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vdservername:7070/main/login\">http://vdservername:7070/main/login</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://10.11.12.10:7070/main/login\">http://10.11.12.10:7070/main/login</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image5.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1. : The RadiantOne Main Control Panel Login Page</p>\n<p>Enter your credentials and click Login. Go to the Wizards tab and click Global Identity Builder.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chapter-2-concepts\">Chapter 2: Concepts</h1>\n<p>This chapter introduces concepts applicable to the Global Identity Builder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"project\">Project</h2>\n<p>A project builds a unique reference list of identities from disparate data sources. This reference list is known as the global profile view. Clients of the RadiantOne service can leverage the global profile view to identify and authenticate users and retrieve profile attributes to enforce authorization and personalization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"identity-correlation\">Identity Correlation</h2>\n<p>Identity Correlation is the process of linking overlapping users based on correlation rules. Once linked, the entries are joined into a global profile and a union is created by RadiantOne.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – Once identities are linked in the global profile, they remain linked forever unless the identity is deleted from a data source or an administrator <a href=\"#identity-unlinking\">manually unlinks</a> them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"identity-source\">Identity Source</h2>\n<p>An identity source is a data source such as Active Directory, Oracle database, Oracle Directory Server, etc. that can contribute identities to the global profile view. Any data source configured in RadiantOne can be an identity source used in the tool. When correlation rules result in a source identity matching exactly one global profile identity, the identities are automatically linked.  If a source identity doesn't match any identities in the global profile, or matches more than one global profile identity, the default behavior is to categorize it as <a href=\"#unresolved-identity\">unresolved</a> and not add it to the global profile.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – Custom data sources are supported. However, you must first virtualize the identities in RadiantOne and store them in persistent cache. Then, use the persistent cache as the LDAP data source for the project. For details on this process, please see <a href=\"#appendix-a-integrating-a-custom-data-source\">Appendix A</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"identity-source-browser\">Identity Source Browser</h2>\n<p>The Identity Source Browser is accessible after an identity source is configured and is an interface where you can search for users directly in the source. Click on <img src=\"./media/image6.png\" alt=\"\"> to launch the identity browser for a given source.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image7.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2. : Identity Source Browser</p>\n<h2 id=\"global-profile\">Global Profile</h2>\n<p>The global profile is a general term to define the final view of correlated identity sources. The global profile view is comprised of a unique list (a union) of identities along with attributes sourced from identity sources or computed in the attribute mappings configured in the Global Identity Builder project.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – the RDN for the global profile entries is a unique identifier that is auto-generated. If you are virtualizing existing groups from backend data sources in FID, you should define a computed attribute for the member/uniquemember attribute in the groups virtual view that uses the remapDN function to lookup in the global profile view to get the list of member DNs. This configuration is described in <a href=\"#chapter-6-linking-existing-groups-to-global-profile-identities\">Chapter 6</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"global-profile-browser\">Global Profile Browser</h2>\n<p>The Global Profile Browser is accessible after identity sources have been uploaded into the global profile. From here you can search for identities in the global profile, see all sources the user is located in, and their complete profile. You can also manually unlink overlapping entries from here.</p>\n<p>From the main project configuration, click <img src=\"./media/image8.png\" alt=\"\">.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image9.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2. : Accessing Identities Browser in a Global Identity Builder Project</p>\n<h2 id=\"unresolved-identity\">Unresolved Identity</h2>\n<p>An unresolved identity is one that either did not match a global profile identity, or matched more than one identity in the global profile based on the correlation rules defined for the identity source.</p>\n<p>Unresolved identities do not automatically appear in the global profile view (unless you've configured otherwise in your correlation rules). An administrator can <a href=\"#chapter-4-manual-identity-administration\">manually link</a> these identities to a global profile identity, or choose to have the identity become a new, unique identity in the global profile.</p>\n<h2 id=\"persistent-cache\">Persistent Cache</h2>\n<p>After uploading identity sources into the global profile, a persistent cache is automatically defined for the view. Persistent cache is a local copy of global profile stored in a RadiantOne HDAP store. Although the Global Identity Builder process automatically defines a persistent cache, a real-time cache refresh mechanism must be manually configured. The persistent cache refresh is the process that keeps the identity sources synchronized to the global profile store. Changes are synchronized one-way, from the identity sources to the global profile. Once the real-time persistent cache refresh process is running, no changes can be made to the project. If changes are needed, you must stop cache refresh. For details on configuring a real-time persistent cache refresh process, see <a href=\"#chapter-5-persistent-cache-with-real-time-refresh\">Chapter 5</a>.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – Real-time cache refresh is the only option available for the global profile view.</p>\n<h2 id=\"correlation-rule\">Correlation Rule</h2>\n<p>Correlation rules are defined for each identity source and indicate how a source identity can be automatically linked to a global profile identity. When correlation rules result in a source identity matching exactly one global profile identity, the identities are automatically linked and share the same <a href=\"#vuid\">VUID</a> unique identifier.  If a source identity doesn't match any identities in the global profile, or matches more than one global profile identity, the default behavior is to categorize it as <a href=\"#unresolved-identity\">unresolved</a> and not add it to the global profile.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attribute-mapping\">Attribute Mapping</h2>\n<p>Attribute mapping is the process of mapping identity source attributes to global profile attributes. During the upload/sync processes, the source identities are inserted/updated into the global profile store and the attribute mapping dictates how the global profile attribute values are populated. This mapping can be a direct mapping where the exact source value is mapped to a single global profile attribute value, or it can be a computed value based on one or more source attributes that get mapped to a single global profile attribute. The mapping can also indicate a constant value to be used for the global profile attribute.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bind-order\">Bind Order</h2>\n<p>The RadiantOne service can send the client bind request (credentials checking) to many identity sources (any that contributed to the global profile identity). After the project is configured, you can define the bind order to indicate the order of identity sources RadiantOne should attempt binds against. For example, if a global profile identity is linked to identities from two different sources, RadiantOne attempts the bind against the source configured first in the bind order. If the bind fails, it tries against the next identity source in the bind order. If the bind fails against all identity sources, the client receives a bind failure error from the RadiantOne service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attribute-priority\">Attribute Priority</h2>\n<p>Attribute priority/precedence can be defined when a global profile attribute is populated from multiple identity sources. The default priority level set for all attributes is <em>normal</em>. This means, when a global profile attribute is populated from multiple identity sources, all unique values are returned in the global profile entry. For example, assume the following use case where two identity sources contain an overlapping user account and both identity sources are configured to publish the title attribute into the global profile. By default, the global profile title attribute contains the value from both identity sources. If the value of the title attribute was the same in both sources, the global profile title would just have one value. In the example depicted below, each identity source has a different value for title, so the global profile title attribute is multi-valued and has both values.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image10.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2. : Global Profile Title Attribute Populated from Two Identity Sources</p>\n<p>You can assign different priority levels for identity sources. In which case the highest priority, non-empty identity source attribute values will be used for the global profile attribute.</p>\n<p>Priority Levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Lowest</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Low</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Normal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>High</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Highest</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"vuid\">VUID</h2>\n<p>The VUID attribute is the unique identifier for the identity in the global profile. All unique identities are assigned a VUID value when the entry is added into the global profile and keep this value permanently. All linked/correlated users are assigned the same VUID because they represent the same physical person. The VUID is unique not only in the enterprise, but also across the world. VUID values are not re-used. If an identity is removed from the global profile, and there are no other user accounts linked to the identity, the VUID is deleted and not re-used.</p>\n<p>An example of a global profile entry and the correlation process can be found <a href=\"#correlationExample\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – Once identities are linked in the global profile, they remain linked forever unless the identity is deleted from a data source or an administrator <a href=\"#identity-unlinking\">manually unlinks</a> them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"global-identity-viewer\">Global Identity Viewer</h2>\n<p>RadiantOne includes an easy-to-use, web-based application named the Global Identity Viewer that facilitates searching for identities and/or groups across all data sources that have been integrated in the Global Identity Builder project. When a query returns an identity, a list of tabs display for the selected user based on how many identity sources the user has an account in. If the identity is found in the global profile list, the attributes corresponding to this account display on the Global Profile tab. The names of the other tabs indicate the identity source's \"friendly name\" as configured in the Global Identity Builder project. When a tab is selected, the identity attributes and group membership associated with the user's account in that particular identity source are displayed. In the diagram below, a user identified as Brian Carmen has an account in the RadiantOne global profile store, and accounts in identity sources named adpartnerdomain, ldap, and azuread. The example shows the adpartnerdomain tab selected and Brian's attributes from that particular data source returned.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image11.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2. : High Level Diagram for Global Identity Builder and Global Identity Viewer</p>\n<p>In order to automate the configuration of the Global Identity Viewer, some properties must be defined in your Global Identity Builder project. These aspects are outlined below.</p>\n<p>Note - If you will not use the Global Identity Viewer, you do not need to define these properties in your Global Identity Builder project.</p>\n<p>For each Identity Source:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Groups object (class) and location (Base DN) – allows for searches on groups from within the Global Identity Viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – if your identity sources contain LDAP dynamic groups or nested groups, you should consider using RadiantOne to automatically compute the membership (e.g. evaluate dynamic groups, and un-nest groups) prior to starting your Global Identity Builder project. Otherwise, when you view the group information from the Global Identity Viewer, they will contain the exact value(s) from the source(s) (e.g. Sales group has the following members ldap:///ou=users,o=directory??one?(department=Sales) instead of the actual members of the Sales group). For details on this process, please see <a href=\"#appendix-b-addressing-group-membership-challenges\">Appendix B.</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Identity Attributes containing a DN value (Identity DN Attributes) that should be automatically translated into the virtual namespace (e.g. isMemberOf, manager)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Group Attributes containing a DN value (Group DN Attributes) that should be automatically translated into the virtual namespace (e.g. uniqueMember, managedBy)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For details on the Global Identity Viewer, please see the RadiantOne Global Identity Viewer Guide.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chapter-3-creating-projects\">Chapter 3: Creating Projects</h1>\n<p>Each Global Identity Builder project builds a unique reference list of identities from disparate data sources. Overlapping identities are linked based on correlation rules and the entries are joined into a global profile. If there are no overlapping users, the global profile is a complete, aggregated list of unique identities. Clients of the RadiantOne service can leverage the global profile view to identify and authenticate users and retrieve profile attributes to enforce authorization and personalization.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – it is highly recommended that you use the RadiantOne Identity Data Analysis tool prior to configuring your project. The Identity Data Analysis tool provides valuable insights into the quality of your identity data and identifies potential correlation attributes. For more information on data analysis, see the RadiantOne Data Analysis Guide.</p>\n<p>When you first launch the Global Identity Builder tool, there are no projects defined, so you are presented with a welcome page.</p>\n<p>1.

The properties are described in this section and an example is shown in the following screen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image14.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Sample Project Properties</p>\n<h3 id=\"project-name\">Project Name</h3>\n<p>Unique name for the project. This value must be a least 4 characters (alphanumeric and underscore only) and not contain spaces. The project contains all configurations related to correlating a set of identity sources and creating a global profile view. This property is required.</p>\n<h3 id=\"naming-context\">Naming Context</h3>\n<p>The root naming context in RadiantOne where the final global profile view is mounted. This property is required.</p>\n<p>Note – the virtual view generated by the Global Identity Builder tool is not editable from the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace tab. Changes must be made using the Global Identity Builder tool. If you need to add interception scripts, computed attributes, or external joins, virtualize/extend the naming context containing the global profile view and define these configurations on the new view. Details on this process are in <a href=\"#appendix-c-extending-the-global-profile-view\">Appendix C</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"global-profile-object-class\">Global Profile Object Class</h3>\n<p>The structural object class(es) associated with the identities in the global profile view. The RadiantOne schema associated with the object class(es) configured for this property dictates the possible attributes to select for the Login Attributes and Search Attributes properties. The drop-down list is populated from the RadiantOne LDAP schema. This property is required.</p>\n<p>A preview of all attributes associated with the selected object class is displayed on the right. Any attribute you want to make available to clients of the RadiantOne service must be available in the global profile object class, <a href=\"#additional-object-classes\">additional object class(es)</a>, or manually added as <a href=\"#custom-attributes\">custom attributes</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-object-classes\">Additional Object Classes</h3>\n<p>The additional object class(es) associated with the identities in the global profile view. This allows you to expand the list of available attributes in the global profile beyond the primary object class configured as the Global Profile Object Class. A combination of attributes from the global profile object class and additional object class(es) are available for defining attribute mappings from the identity sources. The additional object class drop-down list is populated from the RadiantOne LDAP schema and you can select more than one object class.</p>\n<p>This property is optional. If you do not want the global profile identities to be associated with additional object classes, leave this property blank.</p>\n<p>A preview of all attributes associated with the selected object class is displayed on the right.</p>\n<h3 id=\"login-attributes\">Login Attributes</h3>\n<p>A login attribute is one that an application uses to uniquely identify a user to authenticate. Therefore, the attributes configured as login attributes should be populated and unique across all identities in the global profile view. The list of login attributes shown is conditioned by the Global Profile Identity Object Class(es) and Additional Object Class(es). This property is required. When viewing global profile identities, if a login attribute does not have a value and/or the value is duplicated across multiple global profile identities, you receive a message indicating the identity has a <a href=\"#login-conflict-analysis\">login conflict</a>.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – Login attributes and <a href=\"#login-conflict-analysis\">login analysis</a> are purely informative and do not impact the functionality of the Global Identity Builder. This information can be valuable to a directory administrator because it ensures the reference list contains all data required for consuming applications to service end users. For example, if Application A identifies users by a lookup on \"uid\", all entries in the reference list must have a \"uid\" value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"displaysearch-attribute\">Display/Search Attribute</h3>\n<p>The attribute listed here conditions the searches performed against the global profile view from the Identities Browser embedded in the Global Identity Builder. This property is required.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – The attribute selected as a search attribute should contain a populated, unique, single value that is user friendly and mapped in the <a href=\"#attribute-mappings\">attribute mappings</a> from the identity sources. In other words, it should have a unique value for entries in the global profile. This search attribute is also used for displaying identities in the <a href=\"#global-profile-browser\">Global Profile Browser</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-attributes\">Custom Attributes</h3>\n<p>To add an attribute to the global profile view that does not exist as part of the RadiantOne LDAP schema definition for the global profile object class or additional object class(es), use ![](./media/image15.png\" style=\"width:1.44792in;height:0.29167in\" />. Underscores and spaces are not allowed in attribute names. All custom attributes are displayed in the Attribute Preview list on the right. To remove a custom attribute, click &#x3C;img src=\"./media/image16.png) next to the attribute in the Attributes Preview list. Custom attributes are defined as type Directory String, which offers flexibility to store a variety of values. The data type is not configurable.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – Custom attributes are not officially declared as part of the RadiantOne LDAP schema and therefore not tied to a specific object class. If a clients queries the RadiantOne LDAP schema, custom attribute definitions are not returned. If clients need a custom attribute, they must know the exact name and request it explicitly (custom attributes are also returned when all attributes are requested).</p>\n<h3 id=\"runtime-optimizations\">Runtime Optimizations</h3>\n<p>There are two optimizations that can be used to improve upload performance. These options can be modified if persistent cache refresh is not enabled for the global profile view. Disable persistent cache refresh if you need to make changes to these properties. These options are described below.<span id=\"_Skip_Correlation_on\" class=\"anchor\"></span></p>\n<p>Skip Correlation on First Source Upload</p>\n<p>If enabled, which is the default, the correlation rules are skipped during the first source upload into the Global Profile. This offers better upload performance for the first source processed. If your first source contains overlapping identities (same physical user has multiple entries in the source) that must be correlated, uncheck this option. When this option is not enabled, correlation rules are evaluated for the first uploaded source. Same user accounts can be correlated based on the rules defined for the source.</p>\n<p>Automatic Login Attribute Analysis</p>\n<p>If enabled, which is the default, login attribute analysis (to determine uniqueness across all global profile entries) is performed on every operation against the global profiles. This option can slow upload performance so it can be disabled. When this option is not enabled, login attribute analysis is only performed when manually invoked from the Edit -> Login Analysis menu in the project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"identity-sources\">Identity Sources</h2>\n<p>Click <img src=\"./media/image17.png\" alt=\"\"> to add an identity source to a project. For each identity source, you must define the following properties. An example is shown in the following screen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image18.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Sample Identity Source</p>\n<p><strong>Data source</strong> - The data source configured in RadiantOne. This property is required.</p>\n<p><strong>Name</strong> - A unique name to identify the data source in the project. Use alphanumeric and underscore characters only. This property is required.</p>\n<p><strong>Upload Mode</strong> – this option controls how entries are processed when an upload for this identity source is launched. By default, sequential processing is used and guarantees that the correlation algorithm is applied properly. Parallel processing can be used but should only be enabled after ensuring that there is no dependency on the order in which entries are processed.</p>\n<p>Usually, if you have possible correlation within the same identity source (1 or more entries in the same source might correlate with each other), then you must use sequential processing.</p>\n<p><strong>Identity Object</strong> - For LDAP data sources, this is the object class associated with the identities. For RDBMS, this is the database table/view name containing the identities. This property is required.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – Custom data sources are supported. However, you must first virtualize the identities in RadiantOne and store them in persistent cache. Then, use the persistent cache as the LDAP identity source for the Global Identity Builder project. Appendix A provides an example of using a custom data source in a Global Identity Builder project.</p>\n<p>**Additional Object Classes<br>\n**For LDAP data sources, this is the additional object class associated with the identities (beyond just the primary object class indicated as the Identity Object). This property is optional. If the identities are not associated with additional object classes, leave this property blank.</p>\n<p><span id=\"identitiesBaseDN\" class=\"anchor\"></span><strong>Base DN</strong> - The location in the data source that contains the identities. This is only applicable to and required for LDAP data sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Display/Search Attribute</strong> - The attribute listed here conditions the searches performed against the identity source from the browser embedded in the Global Identity Builder application. This property is required.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – The attribute selected as a search attribute should contain a populated, unique, single value that is user friendly. This search attribute is also used for displaying identities in the <a href=\"#identity-source-browser\">Identity Source Browser</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>DN Attributes –</strong> This is a comma-separated list of identity attributes that contain DN values. This is only applicable for LDAP data sources. The values of the attributes listed here are automatically re-mapped in the identity source views so that the DNs match the virtual namespace.  Some examples are isMemberOf, manager, and directReports. This property is used to auto-generate computed attributes in the virtual views from the source. The virtual views are used by the <a href=\"#global-identity-viewer\">Global Identity Viewer</a> application.</p>\n<p>The Global Identity Builder does not correlate or link overlapping groups. The group properties described below are only used to automate the configuration of virtual views from the source and are used to facilitate group searches in the <a href=\"#global-identity-viewer\">Global Identity Viewer</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Group Object –</strong> The object class associated with group entries in the source. This is only applicable for LDAP data sources. This property is optional.</p>\n<p><strong>Base DN -</strong> The location in the data source that contains the groups. This is only applicable for LDAP data sources. This can only be configured for one container. If your groups are located in multiple containers, create a virtual view in RadiantOne that flattens the list of groups and configure the view for persistent cache. Then, use the cache location in RadiantOne as the identity source in the project. Be sure to give this identity source a meaningful name in the Global Identity Builder so you know what the underlying source is instead of using something generic like \"RadiantOne\". Examples of how to address flattening groups and other group challenges see <a href=\"#appendix-b-addressing-group-membership-challenges\">Appendix B</a>. This property is optional.</p>\n<p><strong>DN Attributes -</strong> This is a comma-separated list of attributes in group entries that contain DN values. This is only applicable for LDAP data sources. The values of the attributes listed here are automatically re-mapped in the identity source views so that the DNs match the virtual namespace.  Some examples are member, uniqueMember and managedBy. This property is used to auto-generate computed attributes in the virtual views from the source. The virtual views are used by the <a href=\"#global-identity-viewer\">Global Identity Viewer</a> application. This property is optional.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attribute-mappings\">Attribute Mappings</h3>\n<p>After saving the initial identity source configuration, the attribute mapping page displays.</p>\n<p>Any attribute(s) needed in <a href=\"#_Correlation_Rules\">correlation rules</a>, or that you want to comprise the user's final profile, must be mapped to a global profile attribute. Source attributes can be mapped to target global profile attributes using any of the following methods.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – When mapping source attributes to global profile attributes, the data types defined in the source and target schemas are important. If the source attribute data type is incompatible with the global profile attribute data type, the entry cannot be stored properly in the RadiantOne persistent cache due to problems with indexing. If you have a scenario of type mismatch (this is seen in the upload log associated with the identity source), you can define a Custom Attribute in your global profile project and map the identity source attribute to the custom attribute. Custom attributes are defined as type Directory String and offer flexibility to store a variety of values.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>1-1 mapping – this method allows you to map a single source attribute to a single target global profile attribute. Select an identity source attribute, a target global profile attribute and click <img src=\"./media/image19.png\" alt=\"\">.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto Mapping – this is a quick method to automatically map source attributes to target global profile attributes with the same name. Click <img src=\"./media/image20.png\" alt=\"\"> to apply an automatic mapping.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Function – this method allows you to apply a function to compute a value for the target global profile attribute. Select a target global profile attribute and click <img src=\"./media/image21.png\" alt=\"\">. You can select an attribute from the Insert Attribute drop-down list and click <img src=\"./media/image22.png\" alt=\"\"> to add it to the expression. You can select a function from the Insert Function drop-down list and click <img src=\"./media/image22.png\" alt=\"\"> to add it to the expression. Modify the expression to meet your needs and click <img src=\"./media/image23.png\" alt=\"\">. Click OK to save and go back to the Attribute Mapping screen. The example shown below extracts the leftmost characters (based on the @) in the source entry's mail attribute to populate the global profile Description attribute.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image24.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Example Computed Attribute</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Constant – this method allows you to map a target global profile attribute to a constant value. Select a target global profile attribute and click <img src=\"./media/image21.png\" alt=\"\">. Enter your value in the Insert Constant textbox and click <img src=\"./media/image22.png\" alt=\"\">. If are you finished, click <img src=\"./media/image23.png\" alt=\"\">. Otherwise you can add a source attribute, or use a function in your computation. Click OK to save and go back to the Attribute Mapping screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image25.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Example of Using a Constant</p>\n<p>After all mappings have been defined, you can test the mappings for a given source identity on the right side. Enter a user to search for and the source attributes and corresponding global profile attributes are displayed. The example shown below is for a source identity of <em>djacobs</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image26.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Testing Attribute Mappings</p>\n<p>When you are finished configuring and testing attribute mappings, click <img src=\"./media/image27.png\" alt=\"\">. The next step is defining <a href=\"#_Correlation_Rules\">correlation rules</a>.</p>\n<p>To return to the attribute mappings, on the project page, click <img src=\"./media/image28.png\" alt=\"\"> next to the identity source and choose Mappings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image29.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Edit Attribute Mappings</p>\n<h3 id=\"correlation-rules\">Correlation Rules</h3>\n<p>After saving the attribute mappings, the Correlation Rules configuration is displayed.</p>\n<p>Correlation rules dictate the basis for linking source identities to global profile identities and are comprised of one or more conditions. Each condition is a set of one or more expressions. As you enter expressions/conditions, the display on the right provides a preview of what identities will be \"linked\" based on the correlation rules defined. If the global profile list is empty (which it is until you upload for the first time), there is nothing to compare against, and so the information displayed on the right is irrelevant.</p>\n<p>When adding identity sources to the project, if there are potential overlapping users, you should define correlation rules. When correlation rules result in a source identity matching exactly one global profile identity, the identities are automatically linked and assigned the same <a href=\"#vuid\">VUID</a> unique identifier. When a source identity matches more than one global profile identity, it is categorized as <a href=\"#unresolved-identity\">unresolved</a> and not added to the global profile. Use the option \"Create a new identity when there is no match\" to indicate whether or not a new identity should be added into the global profile when a source identity doesn't match a global profile identity.</p>\n<p>Note – For the first data source you plan to upload, you should check the option \"Create a new identity when there is no match\" because the global profile list starts empty and there is nothing to compare against. You should also define the applicable correlation rules, even for the first source. This would cover scenarios where a user profile is linked to multiple source accounts, is deleted from the \"first\" underlying source and then later added back to the source and ensures they are re-linked in the global profile accordingly (if there were no correlation rules, the user would simply get added as a new identity in the global profile).</p>\n<p>if you need to correlate overlapping users from the same source, and this source is the one you are uploading first, be sure to disable the \"<a href=\"#_Skip_Correlation_on\">Skip Correlation on First Source Upload</a>\" option.</p>\n<p>Expression – an expression is a criteria based on a global profile attribute matching an identity source attribute in some manner. This can be equals, contains, starts with, ends with, present, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, or less than or equal to. Each correlation rule can have one or more expressions and they are grouped by a global operator of AND, OR, or NOT. An example is shown below where the rule has one condition containing two expressions that must both evaluate to true (since they are grouped as an AND operation) in order for a source identity to match a global profile identity. In this case, if the mail attribute in a global profile identity matches the mail attribute in a source identity AND, the employeeNumber of the global profile identity matches the employeeID of the source identity, then these two identities are considered the same physical person and linked in the global profile.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image30.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Example Correlation Rule</p>\n<p>Condition – a set of one or more expressions that comprise a rule.

If all sources have the same priority, and the attribute values in each source are unique, the global profile attribute will be multi-valued, containing all source values. Otherwise, the attribute is only populated from the identity source configured with the highest priority. If the attribute doesn't have a value in the identity source configured with the highest priority, the global profile attribute is populated from the identity source configured for the next highest priority.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – if you change attribute priority after you've uploaded into the global profile, you must re-upload the data sources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upload\">Upload</h2>\n<p>Don't run uploads when the <a href=\"#chapter-5-persistent-cache-with-real-time-refresh\">real-time persistent cache refresh</a> process is running.</p>\n<p>As the number of sources and/or the complexity of correlation rules increases, the importance of the upload order also increases. The first uploaded source should represent the most authoritative list of identities because it establishes the baseline reference by which identities uploaded from subsequent data sources are compared against. Be mindful of the different combinations of identity linking that can occur based on the conditions in your correlation rules and upload order because it can result in identities not getting linked properly, creating duplicate identities in the global profile view or ending up as <a href=\"#unresolved-identity\">unresolved</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"correlationExample\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Consider the example shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image42.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Sample – Identity Correlation</p>\n<p>Assume the upload order is 1) LDAP Directory, 2) Active Directory, 3) HR Database. The LDAP directory populates the title and login attributes into the global profile. The rules to correlate Active Directory entries involves the login attribute and this data source contributes mail and employeeID into the global profile as depicted below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image43.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Sample - LDAP and Active Directory Correlation Rules</p>\n<p>The last identity source to upload is the HR database and the rules to correlate HR entries involves the login attribute or the employeeID attribute as depicted below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image44.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Sample - Database Identity Source Rules</p>\n<p>Now consider if the upload order was different and the HR Database was uploaded before Active Directory. Since one of my correlation rules indicates when login (in the Global Profile) matches LOGIN (in the HR database), this is the same physical person, the John Smith user from the HR database would not be automatically linked to the John Smith user in the global profile. In this case, the attribute to dictate the proper link (employeeNumber in global profile = EID in HR database) would only be populated after the identities from Active Directory were uploaded into the global profile. So John Smith from the HR database would either go into <a href=\"#unresolved-identity\">unresolved</a>, or if you selected the option to \"Create a new identity when there is no match\" when you configured the correlation rules for the HR database, another identity for John Smith would be created in the global profile. Either of these scenarios would require human intervention to fix, to either manually link the accounts or remove the duplicate account from the global profile.</p>\n<p>Note – if you need to correlate overlapping users from the same source, and this source is the one you are uploading first, be sure to disable the \"<a href=\"#_Skip_Correlation_on\">Skip Correlation on First Source Upload</a>\" option.</p>\n<p>To upload identities into the global profile, from the project page, click Upload/Sync.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image9.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. : Uploading Identities into the Global Profile</p>\n<p>There are two sections visible on the upload step.

For example, if the underlying identity source is a database, you must have an attribute mapped to userPassword in the virtual view (that is auto-generated by the Global Idenitty Builder. dv=ids_Database_globalprofile,dv=sourcecatalog,ou=globalprofile,dv=globalprofile is an example) and potentially an interception script that can handle the authentication by calling a stored procedure, or maybe hashing the password value received in the bind request to compare it to the value of the attribute mapped to userPassword. If the underlying identity source is an LDAP directory, the credentials checking is delegated to the backend. If the underlying identity source is a persistent cache, the credentials checking might be handled directly by the cache (if the passwords are in the cache), or delegated to the backend.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chapter-4-manual-identity-administration\">Chapter 4: Manual Identity Administration</h1>\n<p>With every project, there is usually an element of manual intervention required. This is because the quality of the data in identity sources makes it difficult to come up with enough combinations of correlation rules to match 100% of the overlapping identities. The manual tasks that an administrator can perform are described in this chapter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"removing-identities-from-the-global-profile\">Removing Identities from the Global Profile</h2>\n<p>During the design and configuration of the global profile view (when <a href=\"#chapter-5-persistent-cache-with-real-time-refresh\">real-time persistent cache refresh</a> is not running), you may need to remove the entire contents of the global profile or just identities from a specific source. From the configured project, click on Upload/Sync. In the Bulk Upload section, click on ![](./media/image56.png\" style=\"width:0.63542in;height:0.27083in\" /> to delete all identities from the global profile view. To only remove identities uploaded from a specific data source, click the &#x3C;img src=\"./media/image57.png)next to the identity source in the Single Upload section.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTES - The reset options should only be used during the initial design and configuration of the global profile. Once deployed and <a href=\"#chapter-5-persistent-cache-with-real-time-refresh\">real-time persistent cache refresh</a> is running, the reset options generally aren't needed. When you reset a data source, the identities are removed from the global profile. If the identity is the last reference in the global profile (there are no other users linked to it) it is deleted and the unique identifier (VUID) assigned to the identity is removed. In this case, identities that are uploaded again from the same data source are assigned a new value for VUID. If other downstream applications rely on this unique identifier, they are impacted when an identity source is reset because the identifier for the identity changes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"identity-unlinking\">Identity Unlinking</h3>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE – Once identities are linked in the global profile, they remain linked forever unless the identity is deleted from a data source or an administrator <a href=\"#identity-unlinking\">manually unlinks</a> them.</p>\n<p>To manually unlink an identity in the global profile, use the global profile identities browser to locate the identity.</p>\n<p>On the main project page, click on Identities Browser.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./media/image9.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 4. : Global Profile Identity Browser</p>\n<p>Search for and select the identity to unlink.</p>\n<p>A list of data sources the user is from is displayed.
