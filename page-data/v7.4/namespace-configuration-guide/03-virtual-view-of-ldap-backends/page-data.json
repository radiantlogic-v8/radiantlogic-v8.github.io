If you do not plan on caching your virtual view and/or you plan on using a periodic refresh strategy, then using host discovery is fine.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The LDAP services reached are the ones published in the DNS service record. If the LDAP service is not published, it cannot be reached (the service is defined by a host AND port in the SRV record). Some examples are shown below (0 means highest priority level)</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>_ldap._tcp.example.com.    SRV 1 100 389 ldap.example.net\r\n_ldap._tcp.example.com.

SRV 1 100 389 ldap.example.net\r\n_ldap._tcp.example.com.    SRV 0 100 636 ldap.example.net</code></pre></div>\n<p>DNS lookups leverage the domain specified in the host parameter. When the specific domain is set in the host parameter, the BaseDN value can be omitted. To use this functionality, the host option should specify the domain name you are interested in and optionally a port (if you are looking for a specific service on a specific port). If you do specify a port, then RadiantOne tries to get the first LDAP service it finds that is listening on that specific port (no matter what order of that particular service in the srv record). Additionally, if you enter a port and there is no LDAP service available on that port, RadiantOne uses the first LDAP service returned from the srv record.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note – If there are multiple LDAP services available in the SRV record, RadiantOne uses the first five as “main/primary” and “failover” servers. RadiantOne uses these to automatically failover if the primary LDAP is down. Do not manually specify failover servers in the data source.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Below are some examples of the syntax.</p>\n<p>Example 1 - Host specified with port set to 0 (a value of zero means no port is indicated).

The only properties to indicate are server/host, port and if the port is for SSL. The same bind DN and password listed in the primary server are used to connect to the failover servers. If a connection to a backend fails, RadiantOne tries to connect to the primary server again. After two failures, RadiantOne connects to the failover servers in the order they are listed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note – At DEBUG log level, the following comments are shown in the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/logs/vds_server.log indicating that RadiantOne has exhausted connection attempts and is switching to a failover server.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>??

If you want to use host discovery, you can either leave the port blank (and the first server found, no matter what port it is listening on, is used), or enter a specific port (e.g. if you want to access the global catalog or an SSL port).</p>\n<h3 id=\"bind-dn\">Bind DN</h3>\n<p>Service account user DN.

In this case, the specific user that binds access rights override those of the user in the Bind DN parameter in the data source definition. As mentioned before, this is known as impersonation. RadiantOne connects to the backend LDAP server with the user who binds successfully, and the access rights allowed for them are applied when performing all operations (the backend LDAP enforces access rights).</p>\n<p>If user “cn=joe,dc=partners,dc=airius,dc=com,dc=server2,ou=global,o=vds” successfully binds to RadiantOne and accesses the dc=server1,ou=global,o=vds branch, he has the access permissions assigned to the service account user that is specified in the Bind DN parameter of the LDAP data source for server 1. Since “cn=joe,dc=partners,dc=airius,dc=com,dc=server2,ou=global,o=vds” was NOT authenticated to the backend LDAP server that he is now trying to access, he only has the access rights that have been allocated to the service account user (“cn=specialuser,ou=people,o=airius,dc=server1”). This is known as delegation. Had there not been a service account specified for Server 1, Joe would have anonymous access (as described in Example 2 above).</p>\n<h3 id=\"ldap-controls\">LDAP Controls</h3>\n<p>A control is additional information that can be included in an LDAP request or response. RadiantOne can play the role of both an LDAP server and an LDAP client to other backend directories. To understand controls supported by RadiantOne as an LDAP server, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide. RadiantOne’s handling of LDAP controls as a client to a backend directory is described in this section.</p>\n<h4 id=\"vlvsort\">VLV/Sort</h4>\n<p>If a client searches and passes the VLV control against a branch that is associated with an LDAP directory backend (not a persistent cache or a Universal Directory store), RadiantOne forwards the search request along with the included control to the backend LDAP server. In this case, it is the responsibility of the backend LDAP server to implement the VLV control. RadiantOne returns any controls received from the LDAP backend to the client.</p>\n<h4 id=\"paged-results\">Paged Results</h4>\n<p>If the backend LDAP directory supports the paged results control, RadiantOne can request that the results from the backend be returned in pages. The support for paging is enabled, and the page size is set, at the level of the LDAP data source definition.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 29.81818181818182%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a9c7e6521db33b0ef2bd160e30ca3d4e/b966c/Image3.7.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a9c7e6521db33b0ef2bd160e30ca3d4e/c1cfe/Image3.7.jpg 275w,\n/static/a9c7e6521db33b0ef2bd160e30ca3d4e/67061/Image3.7.jpg 550w,\n/static/a9c7e6521db33b0ef2bd160e30ca3d4e/b966c/Image3.7.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 3.7: Paged Results Control for an LDAP Backend</p>\n<h4 id=\"controls-passed-from-client-requests\">Controls Passed from Client Requests</h4>\n<p>All LDAP controls that RadiantOne receives from clients during LDAP modify, modifyDN, add, or delete requests are forwarded to the backend LDAP directory. An example would be a client sending a modify request for a user’s password to RadiantOne along with LDAP Control 1.2.840.113556.1.4.2239. RadiantOne would send the password update to the backend directory along with the LDAP control. The backend directory is the enforcement point for the control. RadiantOne responds to the client with all information returned from the backend directory.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pre-read-attributes\">Pre-Read Attributes</h4>\n<p>This control indicates that all modify, modify DN, and delete requests should include the pre-read control to retrieve the specified attribute’s value(s) as they appear immediately before the operation has been processed. Pre-read controls may be used to obtain replaced or deleted values of modified attributes or a copy of the entry being deleted. The backend directory is the enforcement point for the control. RadiantOne responds to the client with all information returned from the backend directory.</p>\n<h4 id=\"post-read-attributes\">Post-Read Attributes</h4>\n<p>This control indicates that all add, modify, and modify DN requests should include the post-read control to retrieve the specified attribute’s value(s) as they appear immediately after the operation has been processed. Post-read controls may be used to obtain values of operational attributes, such as the “entryUUID” and “modifyTimestamp” attributes, updated by the server as part of the update operation. The backend directory is the enforcement point for the control. RadiantOne responds to the client with all information returned from the backend directory.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proxy-authorization\">Proxy Authorization</h4>\n<p>When RadiantOne acts as a client and connects to a backend directory, certain credentials are used (e.g. the Bind DN and Bind Password configured in the data source connection string). These credentials determine what operations are allowed and it is the backend directory which enforces authorization for this user. Some directories support the Proxy Authorization control allowing a client to switch the user ID, for authorization purposes, without having to re-authenticate with a new connection. If the backend directory supports the Proxied Authorization control, and there is the need to base authorization on a different user than the one who authenticated, you can enable the Proxy Authorization checkbox. With this approach, RadiantOne can use certain credentials (e.g. the Bind DN and Bind Password configured in the data source connection string) when connecting to the backend directory and pass the needed control along with the user DN of the person they want to represent for authorization in the requests. The backend directory checks the proxy authorization rules that have been configured to make sure the service account RadiantOne used to connect with is allowed to represent the person passed in the request. If so, the service account is allowed to perform any operations the person it is impersonating would be allowed to do.

Therefore, client applications can perform searches from the root which could result in querying numerous backend directories. Sometimes, this can affect performance. In order to have more control over which LDAP queries get sent to which LDAP backends, RadiantOne offers inclusion and exclusion search filters.</p>\n<p>From the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace Tab, select the LDAP backend node below Root Naming Contexts.

With joins, you can extend the LDAP entries with attributes coming from another data source, or new application-specific attributes (required by applications, but don’t exist yet). This section assists you in finding the location to configure the join for your virtual view associated with an LDAP backend data source.</p>\n<p>Joins are configured by first selecting the virtual view built from the primary source below Root Naming Contexts in the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace Tab. On the right side, select the Objects tab, choose the primary object class (add it if it isn’t listed), and click <strong>New</strong> in the Join Profiles section. To deactivate a join, uncheck the join’s Active box in the Join Profiles section on the Objects tab and click <strong>Save</strong>. To reactivate the join, check the join’s Active box and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<p>For complete details, please see Joins in the Concepts section of the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optimizations\">Optimizations</h3>\n<p>For certain use cases, there are three parameters that may be enabled to improve processing/performance. They are located on the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace Tab. Navigate below the Root Naming Context section and select the node representing the virtual view to your backend. On the right side, select the Proxy Advanced tab and locate the Optimizations section. Each optimization is described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Limit Attributes Requested from the LDAP Backend</strong></p>\n<p>Whenever RadiantOne queries a backend LDAP, the default behavior is to ask for all attributes (although ONLY the attributes requested in the query are returned to the client). This default behavior of RadiantOne is for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Joins have been configured and the filter in the search request involves attributes from both the primary and secondary sources (i.e. the query filter contains conditions on both primary and secondary objects).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interception scripts that involve logic based on attributes from the backend. These attributes may not be specifically requested or searched for by the client. However, RadiantOne must retrieve them from the backend in order for the script logic to be valid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ACL checking. You can setup ACLs on attribute/values of an entry (i.e. mystatus=hidden), so RadiantOne may need the whole entry to check the authorization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For entry caching. The entire entry needs to be in the entry cache.</p>\n<p>If your virtual view does not require any of the conditions mentioned above, you can enable this option for better performance. If this option is enabled, RadiantOne queries the backend server only for attributes requested from the client in addition to attributes set as 'Always Requested' on the Attributes tab.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Process Joins and Computed Attributes only when necessary</strong></p>\n<p>The default behavior of RadiantOne is to process associated joins and build computed attributes whenever a virtual object is reached from a query regardless of whether the attributes requested come from a secondary source or computation.</p>\n<p>If you enable this option, RadiantOne does not perform joins or computations if a client requests or searches for attributes from a primary object only. If a client requests or searches for attributes from secondary objects or computed attributes, then RadiantOne processes the join(s) and computations accordingly. For more details on this behavior, please see the Join Behavior Diagram in the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n<p>Use caution when enabling this option if you have interception scripts defined on these objects, or access controls based on filters are being used (both of which may require other attributes returned from secondary sources or computations regardless of whether the client requested or searched for them).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE - Do not enable this option if a memory entry cache is used (as the whole virtual entry is needed for the cache).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Use Client Sizelimit Value to Query Backend</strong></p>\n<p>Whenever RadiantOne queries a backend LDAP, the default behavior is to ask for all entries (sizelimit=0) even if the client to RadiantOne indicates a size limit.\r\nThis default behavior is because the entries returned by the backend are possible candidates, but may not be retained for the final result that is sent to the client. For example, if an ACL has been defined in RadiantOne, not all entries from the backend may be authorized for the user (connected to RadiantOne) to access. Other cases are when joins or interception scripts are involved with the virtual view, these may also alter the entries that match the client’s search.</p>\n<p>To limit the number of entries from the backend, using paging is the recommended approach. If the backend supports paging, RadiantOne does not get all the results at once, only one page at a time (pagesize indicated in the configuration). In this case, if RadiantOne has returned the sizelimit required to the client, it does not go to the next page.</p>\n<p>If your virtual view does not require any of the conditions mentioned above (joins, interceptions, ACL), and using paging between RadiantOne and the backend is not possible, you can enable this option to limit the number of entries requested from the backend. If this option is enabled, RadiantOne uses the sizelimit specified by the client instead of using sizelimit=0 when querying the backend.</p>\n<h3 id=\"actualdn\">ActualDN</h3>\n<p>The DN of entries in the virtual namespace may differ from the actual DN from the backend. Therefore, for LDAP proxy views, a special virtual attribute named actualdn is returned by RadiantOne for each entry. The value contains the DN of the entry in the backend directory.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the actualdn attribute in computed attributes, the actualdn attribute must be configured as Always Requested in the virtual view.

If the backend directory supports the Proxied Authorization control, and there is the need to base authorization on a different user than the one who authenticated, you can enable the Proxy Authorization checkbox. With this approach, RadiantOne can use certain credentials (e.g. the Bind DN and Bind Password configured in the data source connection string) when connecting to the backend directory and pass the needed control along with the user DN of the person they want to represent for authorization in the requests. The backend directory checks the proxy authorization rules that have been configured to make sure the service account RadiantOne used to connect with is allowed to represent the person passed in the request. If so, the service account is allowed to perform any operations the person it is impersonating would be allowed to do.
