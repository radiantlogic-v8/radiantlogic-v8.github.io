For more details, see <a href=\"#password-policy-precedence\">Password Policy Precedence</a>.

Enter a policy name applicable to the intended usage and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>\n<p>The ‘Subject’ of the custom policy can be either Sub-tree or Group and is based on a specific base DN. Click <strong>CHOOSE</strong> to select a base DN. If the subject is set to sub-tree, this means that all user entries below the chosen base DN (which must be a RadiantOne Universal Directory store or persistent cache) are affected by the custom policy. If the subject is set to group, this means that all users that are a member of the group specified in the base DN are affected by the custom policy. The group DN can represent a static group (unique members listed in the group entry) or a dynamic group (associated with the groupOfURLs object class and contains a memberURL attribute dictating the members). RadiantOne evaluates dynamic membership automatically to enforce password policies. If a user is affected by a policy defined for sub-tree and for group, the one associated with the group takes precedence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nCustom policy properties override those defined in the default policy. The only exception is the password content properties where you can choose to enable the enforcement of the custom policy, or choose to use the default policy. Keep in mind that a value of 0 (zero) in a custom policy for password content means an unlimited amount is allowed. It does not mean that it is undefined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An example of a custom password policy is shown below. It is applicable to all users who are located in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store and are a member of the Special Users group identified in the DIT as cn=special users,ou=globalgroups,cn=config.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nIf you define multiple custom password policies associated with groups (as the Subject), they should not have the same precedence if they share members. If a user is affected by multiple group-based policies, the one with the highest precedence (lowest numeric value in the precedence setting) is enforced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 32%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Example Custom Password Policy Applicable to a Group\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/b966c/Image3.104.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/c1cfe/Image3.104.jpg 275w,\n/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/67061/Image3.104.jpg 550w,\n/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/b966c/Image3.104.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 3: Example Custom Password Policy Applicable to a Group</p>\n<p>An example of a custom password policy applicable to all users below a specific container is shown below.

The least secure methods of CRYPT, MD5, and SHA-1 have been hidden as options from the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nPBKDF2AD is the required password encryption expected in Azure AD. Therefore, if your HDAP store (or persistent cache) will be synchronized to Azure AD, and passwords are a part of the synchronization, use the PBKDF2AD encryption option to store passwords in the RadiantOne Universal Directory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"automatic-update-to-stronger-password-hash\">Automatic Update to Stronger Password Hash</h3>\n<p>If the “Update stored passwords to stronger encryption after successful bind” is enabled, user accounts that contain a password hashed with a less secure method than allowed for the current password policy are automatically updated to the stronger hash after a successful bind. The only exception to this is for passwords that have a current hash of: PKCS5S2, PBKDF2, PBKDF2AD, SCRYPT, BCRYPT, SMD4, or MD4, in which case the hashing is not changed.

For example, if you set a minimum password length, minimum number of required digits, and a minimum number of required uppercase letters, the rule would be expressed as follows.</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag><min password length> AND <min # of digits> AND <min # uppercase letters>.</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;min password length> AND &lt;min # of digits> AND &lt;min # uppercase letters>.</code></pre></div>\n<p>The Password Strength Rule option allows you to define and test password strength requirements that are more complex using an OR condition. For example, you could use the Password Strength Rule option to require a password to have 'n' number of special characters OR 'n' number of Upper Case characters. In another example, a password strength rule requiring at least six total characters, with at least one lower case, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit OR one symbol would be expressed in the Password Strength Rule field as follows.</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>^.(?=.{6,})(?=.[a-z])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[\\d\\W]).*\\$</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">^.(?=.{6,})(?=.[a-z])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[\\d\\W]).*$</code></pre></div>\n<p>Another example would be if you do not want to allow special characters to be used in the password.

This enables RadiantOne to verify that a user’s password doesn’t contain unallowed strings from a specified dictionary file. This can be used as a method to enforce strong password policies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThe default behavior uses an exact match comparison of the password to a dictionary value.

This property is enforced globally and affects all password policies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can indicate the frequency that RadiantOne records the time of the last successful authentication. The default value is 0s meaning that the last login time is updated on every successful authentication. To change the default, indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). For example, a value of 1d indicates the last login time is updated if at least 1 day has passed since the last successful authentication. Subsequent successful authentications, within this time frame, do not change the last login time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThere is a performance impact on RadiantOne if you keep track of last successful logins because a write operation is performed with a successful bind. It is recommended that you indicate a frequency for writing the last login and that you test the usage of this feature to determine if the degradation in performance is acceptable for your usage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If accounts should be automatically locked when a user has not authenticated successfully for a predetermined amount of time, indicate the threshold (number of days) in the “Account Activity” section of the password policy where you see “Lock user’s account if the user is idle longer than <X> days”. The user’s password must be reset to unlock the account. Once the account is unlocked, if it is not used for login longer than the specified time, the account is locked again. If the value is zero days, this means users will never be locked out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lock-accounts-based-on-number-of-failed-logins\">Lock Accounts Based on Number of Failed Logins</h3>\n<p>If accounts should be locked out after a failed login threshold is met, check the Accounts may be locked out option in the password policy, and establish the criteria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How may login failures are allowed?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enter this value for X (Lockout account after X login failures).</p>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdMaxFailure attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and contains the number of failed login attempts to allow. This corresponds to the operational attribute for the user entry named pwdFailureTime which stores the time(s) of the login failure(s).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How often to reset the failure count?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enter this value for X (Reset failure count after X minutes).</p>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdFailureCountInterval attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. This is the temporary interval of time in which RadiantOne keeps track of the number of failed login attempts. For example, if the number of login failures allowed is 2 and the reset failure account is 5 minutes, this means if a user login fails twice within 5 minutes, the account will be locked. If the user logs in unsuccessfully once and then doesn’t try again until after the 5-minute interval has passed, the number of unsuccessful login attempts is reset and the new failed login attempt counts as the first failure instead of the second failure. This relates to the number of values for the pwdFailureTime operational attribute in the user’s entry which is used to determine how many failed logins have been attempted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nOnce an account is locked, the reset failure count is irrelevant in terms of determining how many failed login attempts have occurred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How long is an account locked out?\r\n<br>Lockout forever\r\n<br>Lockout duration X minutes</p>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdLockoutDuration attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. This relates to the operational attribute <a href=\"#pwdaccountlockedtime\">pwdAccountLockedTime</a> in the user’s entry which includes a timestamp indicating when the user’s account became locked. Once a lockout duration has passed, or a user’s password has been reset by an administrator, the account is unlocked.

If a user’s password is set/reset by the RadiantOne super user (e.g. cn=directory manager), a member of the cn=directory administrators group (cn=directory administrators,ou=globalgroups,cn=config), or the user himself, this does not trigger pwdReset set to TRUE. Only when a user’s password is set/reset by other users (e.g. helpdesk) is the pwdReset set to TRUE. When the affected user logs in with the new password for the first time, they are not allowed to perform operations until they reset their password. For example, if the user attempts a search, RadiantOne responds with error code 53 and a message indicating “You must change your password before submitting any other requests”. After the user updates their password, pwdReset is removed from their entry.</p>\n<p>If a user resets their password, RadiantOne performs the following checks based on the password policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check if the user is allowed to change their password</li>\n<li>Check minimum password age</li>\n<li>Check if old password is provided with new password (if the “Require Existing Password in order to Change Password” policy is enabled)</li>\n<li>Check the password length</li>\n<li>Check the password quality (correct number of required characters – upper/lower/number…etc.)</li>\n<li>Check if the password is in the history</li>\n<li>Check if the password contains unallowed strings based on a dictionary file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the BIND response is returned, it is up to the client to prompt the user accordingly (depending on what kind of password policy response or control was returned).</p>\n<p>RadiantOne returns one of the following responses to the client application:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Modify Response Code</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>53</td>\n<td>User password changes are not allowed.
