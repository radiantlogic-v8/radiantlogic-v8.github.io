It is recommended that it runs as a service in production environments.\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE – When deploying in a cluster, the first node in the cluster is the leader node. No matter how you choose to start the process, the one on the leader node should be started first.\r\nFrom Main Control Panel\r\nAfter starting the Control Panel, login with the super user (e.g. default cn=directory manager) along with the password you selected during the install of RadiantOne.\r\nYou can start the RadiantOne service from the Dashboard tab if it is not configured as a service. If it is, you must start/stop the service directly from the OS services window.\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE – If the RadiantOne service is started from the Dashboard tab, the process is killed when the user logs off the machine. Start RadiantOne as a Windows service to avoid this problem.\r\nAs a Windows Service\r\nOnce you have tested your virtual views and are ready to deploy your architecture, the RadiantOne service can be configured to start as a Windows service. Configure it as a Windows service with the following steps. Perform these steps on the RadiantOne leader node first (if you are running in a cluster). If you are not running in a cluster, perform these steps on any server in your classic architecture.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure that the RadiantOne service is stopped if it is currently running.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\bin\\windows.service directory. You will find fid-server-service-install.bat and fid-server-service-uninstall.bat. These files install RadiantOne as a service and uninstall the service respectively.\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE – if you are running RadiantOne on Windows 7, 2008, 2012, or 2016 you should execute fid-server-service-install or fid-server-service-uninstall as an administrator.  To do so, right-click on the file and choose Run as administrator.</li>\n<li>Execute the fid-server-service-install.bat file. A command window opens briefly and then closes. Check your services window (refresh if it was already open) and you should see a new service for the RadiantOne Server.</li>\n<li>Start the RadiantOne service (be sure to start the leader node first if you are deploying a cluster).</li>\n<li>(Optional) If a local ZooKeeper is deployed (instead of an external ZooKeeper ensemble), reboot the machine to ensure ZooKeeper also starts as a service along with the RadiantOne service.</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 1-5 on all nodes (if deploying in a cluster) or on all other servers if deployed in a classic architecture.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Uninstalling the Windows Service\r\nTo uninstall the Windows service, stop the service and execute &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\ \\bin\\windows.service\\fid-server-service-uninstall.bat. The process of uninstalling RadiantOne as a Windows service does not update the setting in ZooKeeper. Therefore, the Dashboard tab in the Main Control Panel does not properly display the stop/start options for the RadiantOne service since it assumes it is still configured to run as a service. To address this, manually update the asAService property in ZooKeeper. There are two methods you can choose from.\r\n\tFrom the Main Control Panel, switch to Expert Mode. Go to the Settings tab and navigate to Server Front End -> Advanced. Uncheck the Run as a Window Service option and save the configuration. Restart the Control Panel.\r\n\tUse the vdsconfig utility to update the asAService property to false. Below is an example. After running the command, restart the Control Panel.\r\nC:\\radiantone\\vds\\bin>vdsconfig.bat set-property -name asAService -value false\r\nUsing RLI home : C:\\radiantone\\vds\r\nUsing Java home : C:\\radiantone\\vds\\jdk\\jre\r\n0 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManagerConnectionStateLis\r\ntener - Curator connection state change: CONNECTED\r\n9 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManagerConnectionStateLis\r\ntener - VDS-ZK connection state changed: CONNECTED\r\n9 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManager - ZooManager con\r\nnection state changed: CONNECTED\r\nPrevious value: true\r\nNew value: false\r\nConfiguration has been updated successfully.\r\nAs a LINUX Daemon\r\nOn UNIX platforms, the RadiantOne service can be started with $RLI_HOME/bin/runVDSServer.sh.\r\nOnce you have tested your configuration and are ready to deploy your architecture, the RadiantOne service can be configured to start as a Linux Daemon. The startup script is located in $RLI_HOME/bin/rc.d (for init.d scripts) and $RLI_HOME/bin/system.d (for system.d scripts). Documents to assist with the configuration of the service are located at $RLI_HOME/bin/rc.d/readme.txt (for init.d scripts) and $RLI_HOME/bin/system.d/readme.txt (for system.d scripts).\r\nAssuming you are logged into your LINUX machine, use the following commands on the leader node first if you are running in a cluster. Once the daemon is running on the leader node, run the following commands on the follower/follower-only nodes:\r\nFor init.d scripts:\r\nsudo cp $RLI_HOME/bin/rc.d/vds /etc/init.d/<br>\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/vds\r\nsudo chkconfig --add vds   #To automatically configure the vds init script for the configured runlevels (3 and 5, these are defined in the vds script). If you want to uninstall the script, use: chkconfig --del vds\r\nsudo service vds start\r\nps -ef | grep vds   #To verify that RadiantOne FID is not running as root, but as the user that owns the RadiantOne install location.\r\nFor system.d scripts:\r\nsudo cp $RLI_HOME/bin/system.d/vds.service /etc/systemd/system/\r\nsudo systemctl enable vds.service\r\nsudo systemctl start vds.service</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>IMPORTANT NOTE – If you are deploying RadiantOne in a cluster, be sure to start the RadiantOne service on the leader node first before you start it on any follower/follower-only nodes.</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">IMPORTANT NOTE – If you are deploying RadiantOne in a cluster, be sure to start the RadiantOne service on the leader node first before you start it on any follower/follower-only nodes.</code></pre></div>\n<p>How to Stop the RadiantOne Service\r\nOptions for stopping the RadiantOne service:\r\n\tOn Windows and UNIX platforms, the RadiantOne service can be stopped from the Dashboard tab in the Main Control Panel.\r\n\tIf it is installed as a Windows service, it can be stopped from the Windows services menu.\r\n\tTo stop it on Linux platforms, execute: $RLI_HOME/bin/stopVDSServer.sh\r\n\tTo stop the RadiantOne Daemon Process:\r\n\tFor init.d use /etc/init.d/vds stop\r\n\tFor system.d use systemctl stop vds.service</p>\n<p>Global Synchronization\r\nThere are two approaches to starting Global Synchronization, the Main Control Panel and from command line. Each is described below.\r\nFrom Main Control Panel\r\nGlobal Synchronization pipelines can be started from the Main Control Panel -> Global Syn tab. Select the topology from the list on the left. Click RESUME to start synchronization for all pipelines.</p>\n<p>Figure 6. 1: Starting Global Sync for All Pipelines in a Topology\r\nIf a topology has more than one pipeline, you can start synchronization for each independently. To resume a single pipeline, click CONFIGURE and select the APPLY component. Click RESUME.</p>\n<p>Figure 6. 2: Starting Global Sync for a Specific Pipeline in a Topology</p>\n<p>From Command Line\r\nThe change-pipeline-state command in the vdsconfig utility, can be used to start/resume and stop/suspend a pipeline. The syntax of the command is as follows:\r\nchange-pipeline-state -pipelineid <pipelineID> -state <state>\r\nRun the list-topologies command to locate the pipelines identifiers for each topology. This is the value to pass in the -pipelineid. For the -state property, use a value of “resume” to start the synchronization process. Use a value of “suspend” to stop the synchronization process.\r\nFor more details on the vdsconfig utility, see the RadiantOne Command Line Configuration Guide.\r\nControl Panels\r\nThe Main Control Panel and Server Control Panel applications are hosted in a Jetty Web Server. The Server Control Panel can be accessed from the Dashboard tab in the Main Control Panel. The various ways the Jetty web server can be started are described below. It is recommended that it runs as a service in production environments.\r\nWindows Start Menu\r\nAfter installing RadiantOne, execute &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\bin\\openControlPanel.bat (this starts the web server if it is not running in addition to opening the Main Control Panel in your default Internet browser).\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE – If the Jetty web server hosting the Control Panel is started from the Windows Start Menu or using openControlpanel.bat, the process is killed when the user logs off the machine. Start Jetty as a Windows service to avoid this problem.\r\nAs a Windows Service\r\nThe web server that hosts the control panels can be installed as a Windows service and can be set to start automatically. You can configure it as a Windows service with the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the %RLI_HOME%\\bin\\windows.service directory. Control-panel-service-install and control-panel-service-uninstall are located here. You can use these to install the web server as a service and uninstall the web server as a service respectively.\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE – if you are running the web server that hosts the control panel on Windows 7, 2008, 2012, or 2016, you should execute control-panel-service-install or control-panel-service-uninstall as an administrator.  To do so, right-click on the file and choose Run as administrator.</li>\n<li>Verify that the web server is stopped. For example, try going to: <a href=\"http://localhost:7070\">http://localhost:7070</a> (this is using the default port, if you set a different port during the RadiantOne install, you should use it here). If this page doesn’t return anything, the web server probably isn’t running. If it is running you can stop it with: &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/bin/stopWebAppserver.bat.</li>\n<li>Execute the control-panel-service-install file. A command window opens briefly and then exits. Check your services window (refresh if it was already open) and you should see a new service for the RadiantOne FID Management Console.</li>\n<li>Verify the server started by opening a web browser and navigating to: <a href=\"http://localhost:7070\">http://localhost:7070</a> (this is using the default port, if you set a different port during the RadiantOne install, you should use it here). If the web server starts successfully, you can close the browser window and stop the server with &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/bin/stopWebAppserver.bat.\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE – if a cluster, execute the steps described in this section on each cluster node.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a LINUX Daemon\r\nOn UNIX platforms, you can start the Main Control Panel with $RLI_HOME/bin/openControlPanel.sh.\r\nThe Jetty server that hosts the Control Panels can also be configured as a Linux daemon. Documents to assist with this are located at $RLI_HOME/bin/rc.d/readme.txt (for init.d scripts) and $RLI_HOME/bin/system.d/readme.txt (for system.d scripts).\r\nFor init.d scripts:\r\nsudo cp $RLI_HOME/bin/rc.d/control_panel /etc/init.d/<br>\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/control_panel\r\nsudo chkconfig -add control_panel  #To automatically configure the script for the configured runlevels (3 and 5, these are defined in the control_panel script). If you want to uninstall the script, use: chkconfig --del control_panel\r\nsudo service control_panel start\r\nFor system.d scripts:\r\nsudo cp $RLI_HOME/bin/system.d/control_panel.service /etc/systemd/system/\r\nsudo systemctl enable control_panel.service\r\nsudo systemctl start control_panel.service\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE – if a cluster is deployed, execute the steps described in this section on each cluster node.\r\nHow to Stop Control Panel\r\nOptions for stopping the Jetty web server that hosts the control panels:\r\n\tTo stop the Jetty web server, first close the Internet browser where the control panel is running. Then, on Windows platforms, execute &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\bin\\stopWebAppServer.bat.\r\n\tIf the web server is running as a Windows service, stop it (RadiantOne FID Management Console) from the services window.\r\n\tAs a Linux daemon process you can use:\r\n\tFor init.d script use: service control_panel stop\r\n\tFor system.d use systemctl stop control_panel.service\r\n\tOn Linux platforms, execute $RLI_HOME\\bin\\stopWebAppServer.sh.<br>\nOrder to Restart Components when Deployed in a Cluster\r\nTo check the status of each component, go to the Main Control Panel -> Dashboard tab -> Overview section. For cluster deployments, the following is the recommended order to restart the components.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(Optional) Suspend Global Synchronization if used.</li>\n<li>Stop the RadiantOne service. All follower nodes first and then the leader node last. Verify the leader/follower status of each node from the Main Control Panel -> Dashboard tab.</li>\n<li>Stop Management Console (Jetty web server that hosts the Control Panels).</li>\n<li>Make sure all java processes related to RadiantOne components are stopped, if any of the process is still running, please kill from the task manager or command line.</li>\n<li>Start Management Console (Jetty web server that hosts the Control Panels) on all nodes in the cluster.</li>\n<li>Start the RadiantOne service first on the previous leader node, wait until it has fully started and then start it on the follower nodes. To find the previous leader node, login to the Main Control Panel (expert mode) -> ZooKeeper tab and navigate to /radiantone/<version>/&#x3C;cluster_name>. The previous leader is noted in the lastLeaderID property. You can identify the server corresponding to this cloud ID from the Dashboard tab.</li>\n<li>(Optional) Start/resume Global Synchronization if used.\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE - Zookeeper must be running on at least half of the cluster nodes to maintain the integrity of the cluster. Zookeeper starts automatically with the RadiantOne service and/or the Management Console (Jetty web server that hosts the Control Panels).</li>\n</ol>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Chapter 6: Starting and Stopping Components and Services\r\nThis chapter describes how to start and stop the RadiantOne service and the web server hosting the Control Panels.\r\nRadiantOne Service\r\nThe various ways the RadiantOne service can be started are described below.
