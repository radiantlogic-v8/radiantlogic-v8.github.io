More and more identity and security initiatives can benefit from the significant user and group information stored in Active Directory. However, many identity and security applications that have been written and/or customized to work specifically with LDAP directories like Oracle Directory (old Sun Java Directory) have a difficult time integrating with Active Directory. This is primarily due to the differences in schemas. These challenges are compounded when dealing with mergers and acquisitions where the number of Active Directory and LDAP Directory servers that applications must integrate with expands dramatically.</p>\n<p>The RadiantOne platform allows applications that expect a specific LDAP Directory schema to leverage existing Active Directory identity and group information. Applications can query RadiantOne with the schema they expect and RadiantOne properly translates the requests to make them compatible with Active Directory. With this approach, applications can leverage Active Directory information without requiring time-consuming changes and customizations.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 343px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 105.09090909090908%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Object Class and Attribute Mapping Example\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b30b1aaa8e40085deb4aca2d243bb47f/4f01a/Image4.2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b30b1aaa8e40085deb4aca2d243bb47f/c1cfe/Image4.2.jpg 275w,\n/static/b30b1aaa8e40085deb4aca2d243bb47f/4f01a/Image4.2.jpg 343w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2 : Object Class and Attribute Mapping Example</p>\n<h3 id=\"active-directory-integration\">Active Directory Integration</h3>\n<p>The RadiantOne platform helps you solve your authentication and security challenges while keeping your existing Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Like most enterprises with Windows desktops, there is a good probability that your organization has made a significant investment in Active Directory. Now your users are asking why they can't use their AD ids and credentials to log in to all their applications within the enterprise. Your security team wants to take advantage of the group definitions that already exist in AD, and your Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) projects would like a single identity store while your existing infrastructure is comprised of multiple AD domains and forests, and legacy LDAP directories.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, it would make sense to try and consolidate everything into a single Active Directory instance but there are valid historical and logistical reasons for having multiple forests and domains. The need to store additional attributes for application specific entitlements and profiles should also not be ignored. On some levels it makes sense to put all attributes into AD.</p>\n<p>However, AD administrators will always remind you that Active Directory is first and foremost a NOS-based system, and extending the schema can have serious consequences on the core functionality that AD is designed to address. In addition, there is the issue of who owns the data and that certain requirements are better served through the functionality of an RDBMS, not AD.</p>\n<p>With RadiantOne, you can leverage what you already have in AD without having to stretch AD into areas it wasn't designed for. The three most common scenarios for Active Directory integration are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logically consolidating multiple AD Forests and Domains</li>\n<li>Schema Extensions</li>\n<li>Delegated Authentication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These scenarios are detailed below.</p>\n<h4 id=\"consolidating-multiple-ad-forests-and-domains\">Consolidating multiple AD Forests and Domains</h4>\n<p>With RadiantOne, you can keep your existing AD forests and domains while still logically consolidating them into a single directory.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
