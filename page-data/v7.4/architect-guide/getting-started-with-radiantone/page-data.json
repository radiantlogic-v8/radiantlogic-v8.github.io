RadiantOne comes equipped with not only an arsenal of advanced configuration tools to solve the most complex of cases, but also a set of wizards to help you get started in solving some of the most common problems that our customers encounter. This chapter provides a high-level overview of the RadiantOne administration consoles. The identity service wizards are also discussed along with guidance to help determine which will meet your needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"control-panels\">Control Panels</h2>\n<p>The RadiantOne Control Panels are web-based interfaces to provide remote access to the most commonly used tools and wizards. In addition, the control panels offer monitoring, access to server statistics, reports, task management, and other administration options. They can be accessed from mobile or non-mobile devices including iPods and iPads.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note - To access the control panels, JavaScript must be enabled in the Internet browser you are using.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"main-control-panel\">Main Control Panel</h3>\n<p>To launch the Main Control Panel on Windows, navigate to &#x3C;RL_HOME>/bin and run openControlPanel.bat. This starts the web server and launches a web browser login screen for the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<p>To launch the Main Control Panel on UNIX/Linux, after starting the Jetty web server that hosts the Control Panel application, open an Internet Browser and use the following URL:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-http://<server\">:7070/main</code></p>\n<p>The default HTTP port for the web server hosting the control panels is 7070, and the default TLS port is 7171 (you can set the ports during the RadiantOne install).</p>\n<p>The login page displays two fields, Username and Password. Enter your credentials you defined during the installation of RadiantOne.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 268px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7910447761194%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Main Control Panel Login Page\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/40a71da1a112d69c0348cf80a67066bc/3882c/Image5.1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/40a71da1a112d69c0348cf80a67066bc/3882c/Image5.1.jpg 268w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 1: Main Control Panel Login Page</p>\n<p>The following tabs are accessible from the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>\n<p>The dashboard tab is displayed upon successfully logging in to the Main Control Panel.

They are designed to guide administrators through the identity integration process. This includes tasks such as building a unique user list, how to handle group entries (migrate them or create dynamic groups), and how to design the virtual namespace (flat tree or merge into an existing hierarchy). Each wizard is tailored for specific use cases, depending on the needs of the applications that will be consuming the identity. For more information on the wizards, please see the sections below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note – for step-by-step instructions on using the wizards, please see the RadiantOne Identity Service Wizards Guide.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"global-identity-builder\">Global Identity Builder</h3>\n<p>The Global Identity Builder is used to build an integrated list of identities from multiple heterogeneous data sources. This process establishes a common index (union) and reference list for all identities. The result of this process is a virtual view containing a unique list of identities from multiple data sources which are extended with all relevant attributes required to comprise a global profile, with information remapped into whatever format the client application expects.</p>\n<p>The Global Identity Builder should be used in situations where applications require a single source to locate all users required for authentication and/or need to access a complete user profile for attribute-based authorization. It should be used in cases where the data sources contain overlapping users whether there is a single existing common identifier. It can also be used in cases where there are no overlapping users but a complete aggregated flat list of users is required. At the end of the Global Identity Builder process, a persistent cache is configured and initialized for the identity data. Configure a cache refresh strategy from the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab > Cache node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"groups-builder-wizard\">Groups Builder Wizard</h3>\n<p>The Groups Builder Wizard is used to manage virtual views for defining groups and members. With this wizard, you can define rules for dynamically creating groups from multiple heterogeneous data sources. Administrators can utilize this wizard to either create auto-generated groups or user-defined groups.</p>\n<p>When creating user-defined groups, you specify a group name and who you want the members of this group to be. The members can either be explicitly defined by looking for specific user accounts to add, or dynamically defined based on an LDAP filter where any user matching the filter populates the group.</p>\n<p>When defining auto-generated groups, the group name is generated based on a specified attribute available in user entries. An administrator will select which attribute contains the possible group names. For example, if all user entries contained a location attribute, possible group names could be determined by creating a unique list of all possible locations. The list will then be the basis for creating the group names. The group members are then dynamically defined based on who contains this attribute value.</p>\n<p>For more information on user-defined and auto-generated groups please see the <a href=\"virtual-view-design.md#design-considerations\">Design Considerations</a> section of this guide.</p>\n<p>The Groups Builder wizard should be used in situations where applications are accessing RadiantOne FID to retrieve groups/membership for enforcing authorization and a list of applicable groups either does not currently exist in any backend data source or the existing groups are insufficient because they lack all the required members. This wizard should be used if there is the need to add new members into existing groups or if there is the need to build entirely new global groups containing members from multiple different data sources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"groups-migration-wizard\">Groups Migration Wizard</h3>\n<p>The Groups Migration Wizard is used to import existing LDAP groups from data sources into RadiantOne FID. In LDAP directories, the \"address\" (DN) for the user and group entries are static. Existing group membership references user DNs, the naming of which are based on the structure of the LDAP directory. When you model a new directory namespace with virtualization, the group identity DNs will change. Therefore, the group members must reference the new naming. The group migration wizard assists you with the effort of translating the existing group membership to match the new name.</p>\n<p>The Groups Migration wizard can be used in situations where applications are accessing RadiantOne FID to retrieve groups/membership for enforcing authorization and a list of applicable groups exists in a backend data source. The existing groups and users (who are members of these groups) should be virtualized in the virtual namespace. Then, the Groups Migration wizard is used to migrate and translate the group member DNs to match the new naming structure of RadiantOne FID.</p>\n<h3 id=\"merge-tree-wizard\">Merge Tree Wizard</h3>\n<p>The Merge Tree Wizard is used for merging multiple data sources into a single RadiantOne FID naming context, while maintaining the underlying directory hierarchy. The wizard helps you build a virtual view that not only creates a unique list of users across multiple sources, but also allows you to join common users based on different criteria (on a DN or an LDAP filter).</p>\n<p>The Merge Tree Wizard should be used in cases where applications are expecting to find information in an explicit hierarchy which already exists in a backend LDAP directory and there is a need to extend a part of this hierarchy with additional information from other data sources. The Merge Tree Wizard helps you create the view that maintains the existing hierarchy and allows you to append/extend this hierarchy with information from other data sources. A basic example is depicted in the diagram below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 602px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 44.36363636363637%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Example of Merging Tree\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/3658aa12db0351146a8731f1ffa06287/39e41/Image5.4.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3658aa12db0351146a8731f1ffa06287/c1cfe/Image5.4.jpg 275w,\n/static/3658aa12db0351146a8731f1ffa06287/67061/Image5.4.jpg 550w,\n/static/3658aa12db0351146a8731f1ffa06287/39e41/Image5.4.jpg 602w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 4: Example of Merging Trees</p>\n<h3 id=\"directory-tree-wizard\">Directory Tree Wizard</h3>\n<p>The Directory Tree Wizard walks you through the process of defining a new directory tree and\r\nallows you to create a virtual view which aggregates multiple types of backends (a combination\r\nof LDAP and database).
