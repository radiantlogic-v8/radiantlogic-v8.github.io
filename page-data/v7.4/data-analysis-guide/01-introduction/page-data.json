Even if a user is listed in only one store (unless that exact store is already known), an application still needs to locate them, resulting in multiple queries issued (at least one to each source the user could potentially be located in). However, if you have a master index (an “identity hub”), the application only needs to query this list to locate a user, which results in queries to only the backend stores where the user is located. The more sources involved, the more valuable this global index is. It is this global list that is created and maintained by RadiantOne.</p>\n<p>In cases where the data stores contain user overlap, RadiantOne performs aggregation and correlation, creating a common key to identify users across disparate systems. However, the union operation is still important for data sources that may or may not have identity intersection. If they do not have identity overlap there is no need for correlation, but the function of union is still crucial for building your identity service.</p>\n<p>The diagrams below provide a summary/review of data sources containing duplicate/intersecting identities.</p>\n<p>In the first scenario, the data sources have no overlap of identities. In this scenario the benefits of union would still be important for identity management since a single unique index/list is still required for applications to identify a user for authentication. However, the design effort is a bit easier as no correlation logic is required. An aggregation of sources A, B, and C is sufficient, so the primary design consideration in this case is what hierarchy applications are expecting and to build this namespace accordingly.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1100px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 30.545454545454547%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/abeff178dfea608912f2730107c9f690/9e444/Image1.1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/abeff178dfea608912f2730107c9f690/c1cfe/Image1.1.jpg 275w,\n/static/abeff178dfea608912f2730107c9f690/67061/Image1.1.jpg 550w,\n/static/abeff178dfea608912f2730107c9f690/9e444/Image1.1.jpg 1100w,\n/static/abeff178dfea608912f2730107c9f690/e2864/Image1.1.jpg 1530w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 1. 1: Data Sources with No Overlapping Identities</p>\n<p>In cases where there starts to be user overlap (as seen in Sources A and B in the diagram below), the configuration starts to require correlation.
