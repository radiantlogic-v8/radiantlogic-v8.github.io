For cluster deployments, there is one Main Control Panel and one Server Control Panel associated with\r\neach node in a cluster. For example, if you have a three node cluster, you have one Main\r\nControl Panel and three Server Control Panels.</p>\n<h3 id=\"main-control-panel\">Main Control Panel</h3>\n<p>Once RadiantOne has been installed, users should first launch the Main Control Panel, a web-based interface that serves as the central access point for settings and administrative controls.</p>\n<p>The Main Control Panel offers administrators remote access to perform common tasks such as\r\nmonitoring the RadiantOne components and backend data sources, checking server statistics,\r\nconfiguring persistent caches, and managing the virtual namespace. In addition, the identity\r\nservice wizards and Server Control Panel are accessed from the Main Control Panel. For more\r\ninformation on the <a href=\"#starting-the-main-control-panel\">Server Control Panel</a>, see Starting the Server Control Panel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note - To access the Main Control Panel, JavaScript must be enabled in the Internet browser you are using.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"starting-the-main-control-panel\">Starting the Main Control Panel</h4>\n<p>To launch the Main Control Panel on Windows, navigate to the Start Menu > All Programs > RadiantOne > Control Panel. This starts the Jetty web server that hosts the Main and Server Control Panels and launches the Main Control Panel in the default web browser.</p>\n<p>You can also execute &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\bin\\openControlPanel.bat. This starts the web server if it is not running in addition to opening the Main Control Panel in your default Internet browser. Use &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/bin/openControlPanel.sh on UNIX platforms.</p>\n<p>If the Jetty web server is started, you can launch the Main Control Panel from an Internet Browser using the following URL:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://%3Cmachine\">http://&#x3C;machine</a> name>:7070/main/login</p>\n<p>The default HTTP port for the web server hosting the control panel is 7070, the default SSL port is 7171 (you can set the ports during the RadiantOne install).</p>\n<p>Your default web browser opens the Main Control Panel in a new tab. You can log in using cn=directory manager as the user with the password you defined during the install.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 290px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/eeb40a5f0259c653e8d0799e121cde04/baa30/Image1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 73.00613496932516%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/eeb40a5f0259c653e8d0799e121cde04/baa30/Image1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/eeb40a5f0259c653e8d0799e121cde04/d2f63/Image1.jpg 163w,\n/static/eeb40a5f0259c653e8d0799e121cde04/baa30/Image1.jpg 290w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 1 : Main Control Panel Login</p>\n<h4 id=\"starting-radiantone-ldap-and-http-services\">Starting RadiantOne LDAP and HTTP Services</h4>\n<p>You can start the RadiantOne LDAP and HTTP services from the Main Control Panel.
