You should use this value to limit the number of entries the server will look through to find an entry. This limits the processing and time spent by the server to respond to potentially bogus search requests (for example, if a client sends a search filter based on an attribute that is not indexed).

The default is 900, which means the idle connection is kept open for 900 seconds and then closed by the server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"custom-limits\">Custom Limits</h2>\n<p>Custom limits are more fine-grained than global limits and can be defined in the Classic Control Panel > Settings > Limits > Custom Limits section. Custom limits can be configured for the pre-defined users: “Anonymous Users”, and “Authenticated Users”. They can also be more granular and associated with users belonging to any group or located below any branch/naming context (subtree) in RadiantOne.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nMultiple custom limits are not allowed for anonymous users and authenticated users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Custom limits override any Global Limits defined in the Classic Control Panel > Settings tab > Limits section > Global Limits sub-section. The order of precedence (highest to lowest) for global and custom limits containing the same subject is: Group, Sub-tree, Authenticated Users, Anonymous Users, Global. For custom limits defined within the same root naming context, the limit defined for the deepest entry in the tree will take precedence. For example, if a custom size limit of 3 is defined for a subject location of ou=Novato,ou=California,dc=USA and a size limit of 5 is defined for a subject location of ou=California,dc=USA, if a user of uid=Svc1,ou=Novato,ou=California,dc=USA connects to RadiantOne, the custom size limit of 3 will be enforced.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nThis section is accessible only in Expert Mode.

The RadiantOne service needs to be restarted. You can restart the service in your environment from Environment Operations Center.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"number-of-processing-queues\">Number of Processing Queues</h3>\n<p>If you are running RadiantOne on a multi-processor machine, performance and efficiency of the server might improve by increasing the value for the Number of Processing Queues parameter. The default value is 2 and is sufficient for most deployments. As a general guideline, this value should never exceed 3.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThis parameter does not affect the actual number of processors that get used. However, it does improve the utilization of the available processors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A better indicator for performance is the number of threads allocated for each processing queue. For each processing queue, the maximum number of concurrent worker threads is 80 by default. This value can be seen/changed in the Max Concurrent Working Threads parameter. For more details, see the next section.</p>\n<p>After making changes, click <strong>Save</strong>. RadiantOne must be restarted for the changes to take effect. If deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximum-concurrent-working-threads\">Maximum Concurrent Working Threads</h3>\n<p>This is the number of threads the virtual directory server uses for handling client requests. In other words, this defines the number of concurrent LDAP requests RadiantOne can handle. If there are backends involved (e.g. proxy views without persistent cache), then you must also consider how the backend handles the level of concurrency you define here as well because requests made to RadiantOne may directly result in concurrent requests sent to the backend(s).</p>\n<p>The default value is 16, which means 16 worker threads allocated per processing queue defined in the Number of Processing Queues property. This amount is sufficient for most deployments and generally should not be modified unless recommended by Radiant Logic. You might be able to increase this number if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You are using a multiprocessor system - Multiprocessor systems can support larger thread pools than single processor systems. See the Number of Processors parameter above.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clients connecting to RadiantOne perform many time-consuming operations simultaneously (like complex searches or updates).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne needs to support many simultaneous client connections.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is difficult to provide an exact formula for determining the optimal number of maximum concurrent working threads to set because it depends on the machine and environment where RadiantOne is running. Generally, the value for concurrent working threads should not be modified unless recommended by Radiant Logic. If it is modified, you must verify the value you set with testing. Incrementally change the value and retest. In the test results, you should start to see performance peak and then a decrease. The peak in the curve should represent the optimal setting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"max-pending-connection-requests\">Max Pending Connection Requests</h3>\n<p>The max pending connection property represents a queue of server socket connections associated with requests from clients. This is not managed by the RadiantOne process. As soon as a TCP connection is established to RadiantOne, the connection is removed from the pending queue. A maximum number of pending client requests can be set in the Max Pending Connection Requests parameter. This parameter should not be changed unless advised by a Radiant Logic Support Engineer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"access-regulation\">Access Regulation</h2>\n<p>After a client connects to the RadiantOne service, the amount of activity they perform can be limited by configuring access regulation. The activity checking can be performed based on the user that connects to RadiantOne.</p>\n<p>The “Restrictions Checking Interval” parameter indicated in the Per User section is the time frame in which the activity (max binds and max operations) is monitored. Once the time interval is reached, the counts are reset. For example, if Special Users Group checking is enabled, and the checking interval, max bind operations per checking interval and max operations per checking interval are set to 300, 30 and 10 respectively, during a 5 minute (300 secs) period, anyone who is a member of the special users group can bind no more than 30 times to the RadiantOne service and not perform more than 10 operations. This count resets every 5 minutes. If a user attempts to perform more than the allowed number of operations, the RadiantOne service refuses the operation and the client must wait until the checking interval resets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"per-user\">Per User</h3>\n<p>The following groups of users found on the Classic Control Panel > Settings tab > Limits section > Per User sub-section allow you to configure fine-grained activity control:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nMembers of the Administrators group specified on the Control Panel > Admin > Directory Manager Settings tab > Special Group section do not have any access limitations in terms of max connections or max operations per second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1100px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 80%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Special Group Section\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/00cee4670c2d9ea56b7421159c137174/9e444/special-group.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/00cee4670c2d9ea56b7421159c137174/c1cfe/special-group.jpg 275w,\n/static/00cee4670c2d9ea56b7421159c137174/67061/special-group.jpg 550w,\n/static/00cee4670c2d9ea56b7421159c137174/9e444/special-group.jpg 1100w,\n/static/00cee4670c2d9ea56b7421159c137174/0d8fa/special-group.jpg 1243w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"anonymous\">Anonymous</h3>\n<p>An anonymous user is a client who connects anonymously (no username or password) to the RadiantOne service.

Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backends\">Backends</h2>\n<p>Tuning settings for backends includes connection pooling.

When RadiantOne receives a search for information (that is not stored locally, either in cache or a local Directory store), a connection to the underlying system is established. Since opening and closing a connection every time information must be retrieved from an underlying source can be time consuming, RadiantOne can pool the open connections and re-use them (thus saving the overhead involved in having to open/close a connection every time a backend needs to be accessed).</p>\n<p>The first time RadiantOne queries an underlying source, a connection is opened. When the operation is done, the open connection remains in the connection pool (for the specified timeout parameter that has been set). The next time RadiantOne receives a query for the same underlying source, an open connection is retrieved from the pool (instead of opening a new connection). If no connections are available in the pool, a new connection is opened. This process continues until the connection-poolsize parameter has been reached (the maximum number of open connections to keep in the pool). Once this happens (the max number of open connections has been reached and they are all in use), the client must wait until one of the used connections is finished before their query can be processed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connection-pooling-for-ldap-backends\">Connection Pooling for LDAP Backends</h3>\n<p>Connection pooling for LDAP backends is configured with the following settings:</p>\n<p><strong>Pool size</strong></p>\n<p>This is the maximum number of concurrent connections by RadiantOne to each LDAP source. For example, if you have four LDAP sources and your maximum connections value is set to 200, then you could have up to a total of 800 LDAP connections maintained by RadiantOne.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeout</strong></p>\n<p>The default is 7. This is the maximum number of seconds RadiantOne waits while trying to establish a connection to the backend LDAP server. There are two attempts to create a connection (each tries to create a connection for 7 seconds).</p>\n<p><strong>Operation Timeout</strong></p>\n<p>The default is 0 (no timeout). This is the maximum number of seconds RadiantOne waits to receive a response from the backend LDAP server. After this time, RadiantOne drops the request and attempts to send the request again. After two failed attempts to get a response back, RadiantOne returns an error to the client.</p>\n<p><strong>Write Operation Timeout</strong></p>\n<p>The default is 0 (no timeout). This is the maximum number of seconds RadiantOne waits to receive a response from the backend LDAP server for write operations and bind operations. After this time, RadiantOne drops the request and attempts to send the request again. After two failed attempts to get a response back, RadiantOne returns an error to the client.</p>\n<p><strong>Idle Timeout</strong></p>\n<p>The default is 5 minutes. This is the maximum amount of time to keep an idle connection in the pool.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connection-pooling-for-database-backends\">Connection Pooling for Database Backends</h3>\n<p>Connection pooling for database backends is configured with the following settings:</p>\n<p><strong>Pool Size</strong></p>\n<p>The default is set to 20, this means 20 open connections are held in the pool for each JDBC data source. A connection pool is managed per each data source.</p>\n<p><strong>Idle Timeout</strong></p>\n<p>The default is 15. This is the number of minutes a connection stays in the connection pool once it is idle. Setting this to “0” (zero) results in opened connections to stay in the pool forever.</p>\n<p><strong>Prepared Statement Cache</strong></p>\n<p>The default is 50. RadiantOne uses parameterized SQL statements and maintains a cache of the most used SQL prepared statements. This improves performance by reducing the number of times the database SQL engine parses and prepares SQL.</p>\n<p>This setting is per database connection. Use caution when changing this default value as not all databases have the same limits on the number of 'active' prepared statements allowed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manually-clearing-the-connection-pool\">Manually Clearing the Connection Pool</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne supports special LDAP commands to reset connections in the pools. If you issue these commands to RadiantOne, all the connections that are currently not being used in the pool are closed.</p>\n<p>To reset the connection pools from the command line, you can use the ldapsearch utility.</p>\n<p>The following is an example command that clears the LDAP connection pool (assuming RadiantOne is listening on LDAP port 2389 and the super user password is “password”):</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>ldapsearch -h host -p 2389 -D&quot;cn=directory manager&quot; -w &quot;password&quot; -b &quot;action=clearldappool&quot; (objectclass=*)</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ldapsearch -h host -p 2389 -D\"cn=directory manager\" -w \"password\" -b \"action=clearldappool\" (objectclass=*)</code></pre></div>\n<p>The following is an example command that clears the database connection pool (assuming RadiantOne is listening on LDAP port 2389 and the super user password is “password”):</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>ldapsearch -h host -p 2389 -D&quot;cn=directory manager&quot; -w &quot;password&quot; -b &quot;action=clearjdbcpool&quot; (objectclass=*)</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ldapsearch -h host -p 2389 -D\"cn=directory manager\" -w \"password\" -b \"action=clearjdbcpool\" (objectclass=*)</code></pre></div>\n<h3 id=\"active-directory-srv-record-limit\">Active Directory SRV Record Limit</h3>\n<p>If there are multiple Active Directory domains available in the SRV record, by default RadiantOne uses five as “main/primary” and “failover” servers.
