This includes Oracle, SQL Server, and IBM DB2 among others.</p>\n<p>For certain configurations/use cases, there are different parameters that may be enabled to improve processing/performance. They are located on the Control Panel > Setup > Directory Namespace > Namespace Design. Navigate below the Root Naming Context section and select the node representing your database backend. On the right side, select the ADVANCED SETTINGS tab. Each optimization is described below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nSome optimization settings are only configurable in the Classic Control Panel and this is noted in the respective section.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"case-sensitivity-for-searches\">Case Sensitivity for Searches</h3>\n<p>There are three options available for handling case sensitive databases. These options are related to how the RadiantOne service generates the query to send to the database. In the Control Panel > Setup > Directory Namespace > Namespace Design, select the container/content node in an identity view below Root Naming Contexts and on the right side, select the ADVANCED SETTINGS tab.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>As Is</p>\n<p>If your database is not case sensitive, then you should choose the As Is option. With this option, the RadiantOne service forwards the search filter to the backend in the exact case it was received in the request from the client. This is the default option.</p>\n<p>If your database is case sensitive and you choose this option, the case received in the filter from the client search request must match the case used in the database or else the entry will not be found.\r\nFor example, if a database attribute named FIRSTNAME had a value of Nancy, and the RadiantOne service received a search request with a filter of (firstname=nancy), the entry would not be returned. The client must use a filter of (firstname=Nancy) in order for the entry to be properly returned from the database.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ignore Case</p>\n<p>If your database is case sensitive and you are not sure how the values are stored (mixed case, all upper, all lower…etc.), then you should choose the Ignore Case option. With this option, the RadiantOne service generates the SQL query so that both the filter that was received in the client request and the values from the backend are converted into uppercase before the search filter can be validated. For example, if a client sent a request with a filter of (firstname=Nancy), the RadiantOne service would generate the following where clause based on the filter received in the client request.</p>\n<p>WHERE (UPPER(APP.EMPLOYEES.FIRSTNAME)=UPPER('Nancy'))\r\nThe case used in the filter from the client is irrelevant and everything is converted into uppercase.\r\nThis option offers the least performance, so it should only be used when absolutely required. If the database is case sensitive and the values are stored in uppercase, you should use the Translate Values to Uppercase option (see #3 below) as it is more efficient.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Translate Values to Uppercase</p>\n<p>If your database is case sensitive and you know the values are stored in uppercase, you should choose the Translate Values to Uppercase option. With this option, the RadiantOne service translates the search filter value into uppercase before sending it to the backend database. This option is more efficient than the Ignore Case option mentioned above.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"modify-the-exposed-attributes\">Modify the Exposed Attributes</h3>\n<p>To improve the performance of the view, you should only expose the required attributes. The default behavior of the RadiantOne service is to request all attributes from the underlying source (no matter what specific attributes a client may have requested). Having unnecessary attributes in the output can slow down the performance of the query (because it makes the query string much longer).

This is only applicable when the database key is a character data type. “UPPER” is generated automatically for the following databases: Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase, Interbase, and DB2. If you do not want UPPER to be used (because your database is NOT case sensitive), you can navigate to ADVANCED SETTINGS tab > Configuration Paramters and click <strong>EDIT</strong>. Select the BASE PARMETERS tab and edit the Base Search and Update parameters accordingly.</p>\n<p>The Base Search parameter allows you to remove UPPER (that is generated by default) for base searches. If your database is not case sensitive, then the UPPER can be removed. If your database is case sensitive, then you must make sure that the attribute that is indexed (and is used in the base parameter) uses the UPPER case. Otherwise, performance of the identity view (during a base search) is unpredictable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nUsing the UPPER can slow down performance because the indexes in the database may not be used. IF your database has an index on an attribute and it stores the value in upper case, then you have the option of removing the UPPER generated on the left side of the parameter (it is the UPPER on the left that is most costly in terms of performance).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Below is an example of the Base Search filter that is generated for a database. If the database is case sensitive and the CN attribute is indexed (and the index stores the value in upper case), then the UPPER generated on the left side of the “=” can be removed and performance is improved (also remove the leading and ending parentheses).</p>\n<p>The following example:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>(UPPER(SCOTT.PEOPLE.CN)=UPPER(@@[cn : VARCHAR2(60)]))</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(UPPER(SCOTT.PEOPLE.CN)=UPPER(@@[cn : VARCHAR2(60)]))</code></pre></div>\n<p>Would become:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>(SCOTT.PEOPLE.CN=UPPER(@@[cn : VARCHAR2(60)]))</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(SCOTT.PEOPLE.CN=UPPER(@@[cn : VARCHAR2(60)]))</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you are not able to remove the UPPER then you should consider using cache at the level of RadiantOne in order to improve performance. RadiantOne queries the database the first time (the UPPER is used), the results are cached and future queries receive the information from cache.</p>\n<p>The Update parameter allows you to remove UPPER (that is generated by default) for updates to the database. The UPPER is generated when the primary key of the database object is a character data type. The UPPER is used to generate the where clause based on the primary key to locate the entry to update. If your database is not case sensitive, then you can remove the UPPER that is generated in the update parameter and the performance of the query is improved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"request-attributes-only-when-necessary\">Request Attributes Only When Necessary</h3>\n<p>Requesting BLOB attributes can significantly decrease performance. When this option is enabled, RadiantOne requests binary/BLOB attributes from the backend only if they are specifically requested by the client.</p>\n<p>Use caution when enabling this parameter if an interception script is defined (which may need such attributes even if they are not requested by the client).</p>\n<h3 id=\"process-joins-and-computed-attributes-only-when-necessary\">Process Joins and Computed Attributes Only When Necessary</h3>\n<p>The default behavior of RadiantOne is to process associated joins and build computed attributes whenever an object in an identity view is reached from a query regardless of whether the attributes requested come from a secondary source or computation.</p>\n<p>If you enable this option, RadiantOne does not perform joins or computations if a client requests or searches for attributes from a primary object only. If a client requests or searches for attributes from secondary objects or computed attributes, then RadiantOne processes the join(s) and computations accordingly.</p>\n<p>Use caution when enabling this option if you have interception scripts defined on these objects, or access controls based on filters are being used (both of which may require other attributes returned from secondary sources or computations regardless of whether or not the client requested or searched for them).</p>\n<h3 id=\"connection-pooling\">Connection Pooling</h3>\n<p>Connection pooling improves performance because a connection to the underlying source does not need to be created every time data needs to be retrieved.</p>\n<p>Connection pooling for database sources is automatically enabled by default and the settings can be modified in the Classic Control Panel > Settings tab > Server Backend section, under the Connection Pooling sub section (requires Expert Mode).</p>\n<p>To switch to Classic Control Panel, use the menu options for the logged in user in the upper right.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 211px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 98.1042654028436%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Classic Control Panel\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/40229d131643a60eac393edf09c9bfb6/347d9/classic-cp.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/40229d131643a60eac393edf09c9bfb6/347d9/classic-cp.jpg 211w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>To switch Classic Control Panel into Expert Mode, click the \"Logged in as:\" and choose <em>Expert Mode</em>.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 244px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 83.60655737704919%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Expert Mode\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/6284cc5024c660e17524d7b52a21faba/6186f/expert-mode.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6284cc5024c660e17524d7b52a21faba/6186f/expert-mode.jpg 244w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>The Connection Pool settings are described below.</p>\n<p><em>Pool Size</em></p>\n<p>The maximum number of connections that are held in the pool for each JDBC data source.

For example, in the case of querying an underlying Active Directory (with a base DN starting at the root of Active Directory) you may get entries like the following returned:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>ldaps://ForestDnsZones.na.radiantlogic.com:636…\r\nldaps://DomainDnsZones.na.radiantlogic.com:636…</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ldaps://ForestDnsZones.na.radiantlogic.com:636…\r\nldaps://DomainDnsZones.na.radiantlogic.com:636…</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the RadiantOne service attempts to “chase” these referrals, this can result in an extreme degradation in response times. Therefore, it is recommended that referral chasing is disabled, especially if you need to connect to Active Directory starting at the root of the tree.</p>\n<h3 id=\"excluded-attributes-for-active-directory-backends\">Excluded Attributes for Active Directory Backends</h3>\n<p>This parameter is for Active Directory backends. It excludes specific attributes from being returned from the backend. Certain “system” attributes (e.g. dscorepropagationdata) returned from Active Directory (even for non-admin users) can cause problems for building persistent cache because the data type is not handled properly, and these attributes need to be added to the RadiantOne schema for the local storage to handle them in the cache. Also, these attributes cause problems for the change capture connector needed for real-time persistent cache refresh to work properly. Attributes that are not required by client applications, should be added to this list to ensure they are not returned in the view from Active Directory. By default, the AD attributes that are excluded are ds*, acs*, ms* and frs* (* is a wildcard meaning that any attributes with those prefixes are excluded). Any attributes that you do not want returned from the backend Active Directory can be added to the Attributes excluded from search results (support for Active Directory) list which is found on the Classic Control Panel > Settings tab > Server Front End section > Attributes Handling sub-section. Make sure a space separates the attributes listed.</p>\n<p>To switch to Classic Control Panel, use the menu options for the logged in user in the upper right.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 211px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 98.1042654028436%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Classic Control Panel\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/40229d131643a60eac393edf09c9bfb6/347d9/classic-cp.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/40229d131643a60eac393edf09c9bfb6/347d9/classic-cp.jpg 211w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"index-attributes-used-in-joins-1\">Index Attributes Used in Joins</h3>\n<p>If joins are configured, verify that all attributes conditioning the join are indexed in the underlying sources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-attributes-requested-from-the-ldap-backend\">Limit Attributes Requested from the LDAP Backend</h3>\n<p>The <em>Limit Attributes Requested from the LDAP Backend</em> option is located in Control Panel > Setup > Directory Namespace > Namespace Design > [SelectedIdentityView] > ADVANCED SETTINGS tab > Optimizations section.</p>\n<p>Whenever the RadiantOne service queries a backend LDAP directory, the default behavior is to ask for all attributes (although ONLY the attributes requested in the query are returned to the client).

If this property is set to zero, all attributes specified in the Final Output Object on the canvas on the OBJECT BUILDER tab are requested.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connection-pooling-1\">Connection Pooling</h3>\n<p>JNDI connection pooling to a backend LDAP source is enabled by default.</p>\n<p>To change the maximum connections to maintain in the pool, the idle timeout, or connection timeout, go to the Classic Control Panel > Settings tab > Server Backend section, under the Connection Pooling sub section (requires Expert Mode).</p>\n<p>To switch to Classic Control Panel, use the menu options for the logged in user in the upper right.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 211px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 98.1042654028436%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Classic Control Panel\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/40229d131643a60eac393edf09c9bfb6/347d9/classic-cp.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/40229d131643a60eac393edf09c9bfb6/347d9/classic-cp.jpg 211w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>To switch Classic Control Panel into Expert Mode, click the \"Logged in as:\" and choose <em>Expert Mode</em>.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 244px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 83.60655737704919%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Expert Mode\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/6284cc5024c660e17524d7b52a21faba/6186f/expert-mode.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6284cc5024c660e17524d7b52a21faba/6186f/expert-mode.jpg 244w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>The Connection Pool settings are described below.</p>\n<p><em>Pool Size</em></p>\n<p>Default is 1000.

This is the process to stage the backend data in persistent cache. Most custom backends only support a periodic persistent cache refresh type. Then, as a second step, create an identity view using the cache image as the data source. This identity view is where you would configure the attribute mappings, computed attributes, joins...etc. This data staging and virtual view layering methodology is essential for custom backend data source (e.g. Azure AD, Okta, Salesforce...etc.) that are not as performant as directories for search queries and even works well for RDBMS data sources.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"overview"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Overview"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Depending on the data source type that an identity view is built from, different optimization settings are available."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"views-from-database-backends"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Views from Database Backends"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Database backends are any source accessed via JDBC or ODBC.

This is the process to stage the backend data in persistent cache. Most custom backends only support a periodic persistent cache refresh type. Then, as a second step, create an identity view using the cache image as the data source. This identity view is where you would configure the attribute mappings, computed attributes, joins...etc. This data staging and virtual view layering methodology is essential for custom backend data source (e.g. Azure AD, Okta, Salesforce...etc.) that are not as performant as directories for search queries and even works well for RDBMS data
