If the source file has been tampered with, the above command returns “Verification Failure”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changelog\">Changelog</h2>\n<p>The changelog is one of the recommended approaches for other processes to detect changes that have happened to RadiantOne entries. The <a href=\"/configuration/global-settings/client-protocols#supported-controls\">Persistent Search control</a> is the other method that can be used.</p>\n<p>The Changelog can be enabled from the Classic Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Changelog sub-section. If enabled, the change log stores all modifications made to any entry in the RadiantOne namespace including entries that are stored in persistent cache. The contents of the change log can be viewed below the cn=changelog suffix in the directory.This suffix is indicated in the RadiantOne rootDSE changelog attribute. The rootDSE also contains the firstchangenumber and lastchangenumber attributes. This information can be used by clients as a cursor to track changes. Access the rootDSE by querying the RadiantOne service with an empty/blank Base DN.</p>\n<p>Each entry in the changelog is comprised of the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>changeNumber – number that uniquely identifies an entry</li>\n<li>changes – LDIF formatted value that describes the changes made to the entry.</li>\n<li>changeTime – time of the change.</li>\n<li>changeType – type of change: add, modify, delete</li>\n<li>entrydn – DN of the entry that changed.</li>\n<li>objectClass – all entries are associated with top and changelogEntry object classes.</li>\n<li>targetContextId – used internally by RadiantOne for isolation per naming context.</li>\n<li>targetDN - DN of the entry that changed.</li>\n<li>timestampms –used by RadiantOne internally for changelog isolation per naming context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details on these operational attributes, see <a href=\"/configuration/directory-stores/understanding-operational-attributes\">Operational Attributes</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disabling-changelog-for-certain-naming-contexts\">Disabling Changelog for Certain Naming Contexts</h3>\n<p>Changes to entries in certain naming contexts representing certain RadiantOne Directory stores or persistent cache, are not applicable to logging into change log (e.g. cn=replicationjournal, cn=config…etc.). Other naming contexts that represent backend directories (proxy views to these directories) might not require changelog either. Therefore, these naming contexts can have this function disabled. The list of disabled naming contexts is configured from the Changelog sub-section. Uncheck the Changelog box to disable the naming context.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nIn most cases, this setting should not be touched. Only naming contexts representing RadiantOne Directory stores, persistent cache, or proxy views are shown in the list. Disabling changelog for certain naming contexts should only be done when advised by Radiant Logic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"automatic-backup-of-changelog\">Automatic Backup of Changelog</h3>\n<p>Whenever the RadiantOne service starts, the changelog storage is checked to see if there are enough change numbers left for use (a total of 2 billion numbers are allocated for use). If there is less than 10% of the 2 billion numbers left, the existing records are automatically be rolled over into the corresponding backup storage and the change number will start over at number 1.</p>\n<p>While the RadiantOne service running, once the change log number reaches 90% capacity (90% of the allocated 2 billion numbers are used), the following warning message will appear in the RadiantOne log \"!!! 90% change numbers have been used! The VDS should be restarted to prevent any possible exhaust of change number and loss of change records.\" When this message appears, the RadiantOne service should be restarted. If it is not restarted and the entire 2 billion allocated numbers are used, changes are no longer logged into the changelog.</p>\n<h3 id=\"excluded-change-log-attributes\">Excluded Change Log Attributes</h3>\n<p>When entries are changed, the change log reports the attributes under its \"changes\" attribute. This may pose a security risk if sensitive attributes have been changed, and the change log is searchable by outside applications such as sync connectors. To eliminate this risk, the Excluded Change Log Attributes option allows you to exclude selected attributes from members of the “ChangelogAllowedAttributesOnly” group. Though these attributes are logged in the change log, they are not returned for these group members when performing a search on the change log.</p>\n<p>To exclude attributes in changelog searches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the New Control Panel, navigate to Manage > Directory Browser.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expand cn=config and ou=groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select cn=ChangelogAllowedAttributesOnly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add users and/or groups that you do not want to have access to the “changes” attribute for certain attributes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To edit the list of attributes to exclude from the changelog, use the RadiantOne REST API, set-property <em>changelogExcludedAttributes</em>. In brackets, enter attributes to be excluded in a comma-separated list. Wrap each attribute in double quotes. An example is shown below:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>https://rst-rlqa-usw2-env.dev01.radiantlogic.io/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&commandname=set-property&name=changelogExcludedAttributes&value=[&quot;mail&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;homePhone&quot;]</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">https://rst-rlqa-usw2-env.dev01.radiantlogic.io/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&amp;commandname=set-property&amp;name=changelogExcludedAttributes&amp;value=[\"mail\", \"l\", \"homePhone\"]</code></pre></div>\n<p>When a member of the group searches the changelog, the specified attributes are not included in the “changes” attribute.

The maximum age parameter specifies the number of days an entry stays in storage for the following event stores.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cn=changelog</li>\n<li>cn=cacherefreshlog</li>\n<li>cn=replicationjournal</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\nMaximum age also applies to the vdsSyncHist attribute maintained at the level of entries involved in inter-cluster replication. This attribute is multi-valued and continues to grow until the RadiantOne service scans the values and removes ones that are older than the maximum age. RadiantOne scans the values only when the entry is modified. For entries that aren’t updated often, vdsSyncHist will potentially contain values that are older than the maximum age.**</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>cn=localjournal</li>\n<li>cn=tombstone</li>\n<li>stores below cn=queue</li>\n<li>stores below cn=dlqueue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Records older than the maximum age are deleted automatically. Old change log numbers (from deleted records) do not get re-used.</p>\n<p>This parameter is set in the Classic Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Changelog sub-section. The default value is 3 days which means records are automatically deleted after 3 days.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replication-journal-read-timeout\">Replication Journal Read Timeout</h3>\n<p>This is the number of milliseconds RadiantOne waits to receive a response from the replication journal. When the replication journal read timeout time is exceeded, RadiantOne skips the entry, and the next entry in the replication journal is searched. The next time the RadiantOne node checks the replication journal, it attempts to read the skipped entries.</p>\n<p>This setting can be viewed and set through the RadiantOne REST API.  Use the get-property command to get the current value. Use the set-property command to update the value.</p>\n<p>To get the value (update the hostname for your environment):</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>https://rst-rlqa-usw2-env.dev01.radiantlogic.io/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&commandname=get-property&name=replicationReadTimeoutMS</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">https://rst-rlqa-usw2-env.dev01.radiantlogic.io/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&amp;commandname=get-property&amp;name=replicationReadTimeoutMS</code></pre></div>\n<p>To set the value to 50ms (update the hostname for your environment):</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>https://rst-rlqa-usw2-env.dev01.radiantlogic.io/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&commandname=set-property&name=replicationReadTimeoutMS&value=50</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">https://rst-rlqa-usw2-env.dev01.radiantlogic.io/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&amp;commandname=set-property&amp;name=replicationReadTimeoutMS&amp;value=50</code></pre></div>\n<p>The default is 0 (no timeout) meaning that the RadiantOne service waits forever for a response from the query to the replication journal. If the replicationReadTimeMS property is zero and there is a non-zero value for the Operation Timeout in the JNDI Pooling property (Classic Control Panel > Settings > Server Backend > Connection Pooling), RadiantOne uses the Operation Timeout value to determine how long to wait for a response when querying the replication journal. If the replicationReadTimeMS property has a non-zero value, then it overrides the Operation Timeout value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"persistent-cache-refresh-log-level\">Persistent Cache Refresh Log Level</h3>\n<p>Activity performed against a persistent cache is logged below a branch in the RadiantOne namespace named cn=cacherefreshlog. This log is always enabled and the level can be set to all, status, or just errors. The level is set on the Classic Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Changelog sub-section, Persistent Cache Refresh Log Level parameter.</p>\n<p>If <em>all</em> log level is selected, the cn=cacherefreshlog branch contains all requests (successful or not) to refresh the persistent cache. This includes information about the exact changes (what information changed). The attribute named ‘changes’ contains the attribute level changes. The format is compatible with the changelog format.</p>\n<p>The latest IETF description of it is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/directory/ietf-docs/draft-good-ldap-changelog-03.txt\">http://www.mozilla.org/directory/ietf-docs/draft-good-ldap-changelog-03.txt</a></p>\n<p>The ‘changes’ attribute is actually an LDIF representation of the change as defined in:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ietfreport.isoc.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt\">http://ietfreport.isoc.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt</a></p>\n<p>The difference between <em>status</em> level and <em>all</em> level is that all only logs entries that have <strong>actually</strong> changed whereas status level logs all changes coming into the persistent cache whether the actual entry has changed or not. To provide an example, say you have cached data from a materialized view in a database and are using triggers to detect changes on the database. A materialized view may be rebuilt daily, triggering many “changes” detected by the RadiantOne change capture connector. On a more simplistic level, updating an entry with the exact same value results in the connector picking up an update change. Therefore, the persistent cache connector sends a cache refresh to RadiantOne for the entry that was updated. If the cache refresh log level is set to <em>status</em>, this update is logged in the cn=cacherefreshlog. If the cache refresh log level is <em>all</em>, the existing entry in persistent cache is compared with the entry received in the message from the connector, if the entry really has changed, it is stored in the cache refresh log. If the entry did not change, then the “change” is not documented in the cacherefresh log. Because of this, the <em>all</em> log level generates LESS entries in the cn=cacherefreshlog, and documents which attribute actually changed, but is more time consuming because of the comparison required.</p>\n<p>On the new Control Panel > Manage > Directory Browser, navigate to the cn=cacherefreshlog branch to view the persistent cache activity.</p>\n<p>The information logged can be used for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To update some other RadiantOne persistent caches that contains the same information.</li>\n<li>As a location where any user/application can review to see what changes were made to the persistent cache and when.</li>\n<li>To monitor errors in case one of the underlying sources is down when RadiantOne attempts to get the latest image.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All changes to persistent cache branches are logged in the cn=changelog. Therefore, the persistent cache refresh log level is typically set to error to log only entries that could not be refreshed in the cache. The other log levels are still available to support backward compatibility (when changes to the persistent cache branches were not logged into the general change log).</p>\n<h2 id=\"radiantone-directory-store-statistics\">RadiantOne Directory Store Statistics</h2>\n<p>RadiantOne logs statistics related to operations it receives. This includes average execution time, peak execution time, and whether the operation was successful. No actual data (entires/attributes) is logged, only metadata. This log is primarily for Radiant Logic support to have key information to assist with troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>This logging is enabled by default and can be managed from the Classic Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Statistics > Statistics Analyzer Settings sub-section. The log name is stats.log and statistics are calculated in one minute intervals.</p>\n<p>For each RadiantOne Directory store or persistent cache initialization, statistics are calculated for the total number of entries and sub-categorized by branches and object classes. The average and peak number of attributes per entry, and the average and peak size (in KB) per entry are also calculated.
