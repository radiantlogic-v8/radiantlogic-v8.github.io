The type of data source determines which capture methods are available.</p>\n<p>This section focuses on configuring the connector type. For details on the behavior of and properties for database connectors (Timestamp, Counter, Changelog), LDAP connectors (changelog or persistent search), and Active Directory connectors (usnChanged or DirSync), please see the <a href=\"./cache-connector-properties\">Connector Properties</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"database-jdbc-accessible-connectors\">Database (JDBC-accessible) Connectors</h2>\n<p>For database backends (JDBC-accessible), the connector change detection options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#database-changelog-connector\">Changelog</a> – This connector type relies on a database table that contains all changes that have occurred on the base tables (that the RadiantOne identity view is built from). This typically involves having triggers on the base tables that write into the log/changelog table. However, an external process may be used instead of triggers. The connector picks up changes from the changelog table. If you need assistance with configuring triggers on the base tables and defining the changelog table, see <a href=\"#create-scripts-to-generate-triggers-and-changelog-table\">Create scripts to generate triggers and changelog table</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#database-timestamp-connector\">Timestamp</a> – This connector type has been validated against Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Apache Derby. The database table must have a primary key defined for it and an indexed column that contains a timestamp/date value. This value must be maintained and modified accordingly for each record that is updated.</p>\n<p>For Oracle databases, the timestamp column type must be one of the following: <code class=\"language-text\">TIMESTAMP</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">DATE</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE</code>, `TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE1.</p>\n<p>For SQL Server database, the timestamp column type must be one of the following: <code class=\"language-text\">SMALLDATETIME</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">DATETIME</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">DATETIME2</code></p>\n<p>For MYSQL or MariaDB databases, the timestamp column type must be one of the following: <code class=\"language-text\">TIMESTAMP</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">DATETIME</code></p>\n<p>For PostgreSQL databases, the timestamp column type must be one of the following: <code class=\"language-text\">TIMESTAMP</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">timestamp without time zone</code> (equivalent to timestamp), <code class=\"language-text\">TIMESTAMPTZ</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">timestamp with time zone</code> (equivalent to timestamptz)</p>\n<p>For Derby databases, the timestamp column type must be: <code class=\"language-text\">TIMESTAMP</code></p>\n<p>The DB Timestamp connector leverages the timestamp column to determine which records have changed since the last polling interval. This connector type does not detect delete operations. If you have a need to detect and propagate delete operations from the database, you should choose a different connector type like DB Changelog or DB Counter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#database-counter-connector\">Counter</a> - This connector type is supported for any database table that has an indexed column that contains a sequence-based value that is automatically maintained and modified for each record that is added/updated. This column must be one of the following types: <code class=\"language-text\">BIGINT</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">DECIMAL</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">INTEGER</code>, or <code class=\"language-text\">NUMERIC</code>. If <code class=\"language-text\">DECIMAL</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">NUMERIC</code> are used, they should be declared without numbers after dot: <code class=\"language-text\">DECIMAL(6,0)</code> not as <code class=\"language-text\">DECIMAL(6,2)</code>. The DB Counter connector leverages this column to determine which records have changed since the last polling interval. This connector type can detect delete operations as long as the table has a dedicated \"Change Type\" column that indicates one of the following values: insert, update, delete. If the value is empty or something other than insert, update, or delete, an update operation is assumed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"database-changelog-connector\">Database Changelog Connector</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne can generate the SQL scripts which create the configuration needed to support the DB Changelog Connector. The scripts can be generated in the Main Control Panel. The following scripts are generated and can be download from Main Control Panel > Settings > Configuration > File Manager.  The are located in the /work/sql folder.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create_user.sql - Creates the log table user and the log table schema.</li>\n<li>create_capture.sql - Creates the log table and the triggers on the base table.</li>\n<li>drop_capture.sql - Drops the triggers and the log tabl1.\nNote: for some databases the file is empty.</li>\n<li>drop_user.sql - Drops the log table user and schem1.\nNote: for some databases the file is empty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This section describes generating and executing the scripts in the Classic Control Panel > Synchronization tab. The following steps assume the database backend has a changelog table that contains changed records that need to be propagated to destinations. The changelog table must have two key columns named <code class=\"language-text\">RLICHANGETYPE</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">RLICHANGEID</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">RLICHANGETYPE</code> must indicate insert, update or delete, dictating what type of change was made to the record. <code class=\"language-text\">RLICHANGEID</code> must be a sequence-based, auto-incremented <code class=\"language-text\">INTEGER</code> that contains a unique value for each record. The DB Changelog connector uses <code class=\"language-text\">RLICHANGEID</code> to maintain a cursor to keep track of processed changes.</p>\n<p>If you need assistance with configuring triggers on the base tables and defining the changelog table, see <a href=\"#create-scripts-to-generate-triggers-and-changelog-table\">Create scripts to generate triggers and changelog table</a>.</p>\n<p>To configure DB Changelog connector:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\nThese instructions assume you want to apply the SQL scripts immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To configure the database changelog connector for real-time persistent cache refresh:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the Control Panel, go to Setup > Directory Namespace > Namespace Design.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the root naming context that contains the identity view that is cached.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the right side, click the <strong>CACHE</strong> tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you haven't already created the cache, click <strong>+CREATE NEW CACHE</strong> and browse to the branch in the RadiantOne namespace that you would like to store in persistent cache and click <strong>CREATE</strong>.

Please check the vendor documentation for assistance with configuring replication for your backends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The database connectors leverage the failover server that has been configured for the data source. When you configure a data source for your backend database, select a failover database server from the drop-down list. The failover server must be configured as a RadiantOne data source. See the screen shot below for how to indicate a failover server for the Data Sources from the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/image33.png\" alt=\"Configuring Failover Servers for the Backend Database\"></p>\n<p>If a connection cannot be made to the primary server, the connector tries to connect to the failover server configured in the data source. If a connection to both the primary and failover servers fails, the retry count goes up. The connector repeats this process until the value configured in \"Max Retries on Connection Error\" is reached. There is no automatic failback, meaning once the primary server is back online, the connector does not automatically go back to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ldap-directory-ldap-accessible-connectors\">LDAP Directory (LDAP-accessible) Connectors</h2>\n<p>For directory backends (LDAP-accessible), the connector change detecion options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#changelog\">Changelog</a> - leverages the cn=changelog naming context in the LDAP directory to detect changes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#persistent-search\">Persistent Search</a> - leverages the LDAP persistent search control to detect changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"changelog\">Changelog</h3>\n<p>The connector leverages a changelog that has been enabled on the backend directory. The connector picks up changes from the <code class=\"language-text\">cn=changelog</code> naming context based on a polling interval. The <code class=\"language-text\">changenumber</code> attribute in the changelog entries is used to keep track of the processed changes. The changelog must be enabled in the backend directory. Please check with your directory vendor for instructions on how to enable the changelog.</p>\n<h3 id=\"persistent-search\">Persistent search</h3>\n<p>Any LDAP directory that offers a persistent search mechanism can use the Persistent Search connector type. Novell eDirectory is an example of an LDAP source that supports persistent search. Others include Red Hat Directory, IBM TDS, CA Directory and RadiantOne Universal Directory. The connector issues a persistent search and gets notified by the directory server when information changes. If the connector is shut down (either deliberately or due to failure), the delete operations that occurred in the directory are lost. Once the connector is back online there is no way to detect the delete operations that occurred while it was down. The only exception to this is for IBM TDS directories. It stores deleted entries and the capture connector is able to read them, and based on timestamp, determine if the change occurred while the connector was offline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"active-directory-connectors\">Active Directory Connectors</h2>\n<p>There are three change detection mechanisms: USNChanged, DirSync and Hybrid. If you are virtualizing and detecting changes from a Global Catalog, then you must use the USNChanged changed connector because the DirSync and Hybrid connectors cannot detect change events on sub-domains.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#dirsync\">DirSync</a> - leverages Active Directory DirSync to detect changes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#usnchanged\">USNChanged</a> - leverages the USNChanged attribute managed by Active Directory to detect changes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#hybrid\">Hybrid</a> - leverages capabilities of both Active Directory DirSync and USNChanged values to detect changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The flowchart below helps to decide which change detection mechanism to use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/image36.png\" alt=\"Change detection mechanism flowchart\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"dirsync\">DirSync</h3>\n<p>This connector type retrieves changes that occur to entries by passing a cookie that identifies the directory state at the time of the previous DirSync search. The first time the DirSync capture connector is started, it stores a cookie in a cursor file. At the next polling interval, the connector performs a DirSync search to detect changes by sending the current cookie. To use the DirSync control, the Bind DN connecting to the directory must have the DS-Replication-Get-Changes extended right, which can be enabled with the \"Replicating Directory Changes\" permission, on the root of the partition being monitored. By default, this right is assigned to the Administrator and LocalSystem accounts on domain controllers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nTo detect delete events, the service account used by RadiantOne to connect to the backend Active Directory (configured in the connection string of the RadiantOne data source) must have permissions to search the tombstone objects. Usually, a member of the Administrators group is sufficient. However, some Active Directory servers may require a member of the Domain Admins group. Check with your Active Directory administrator to determine the appropriate credentials required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you are virtualizing and detecting changes from a Global Catalog, then you must use the Active Directory USNChanged changed connector because the DirSync connector cannot detect change events on sub-domains.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usnchanged\">USNChanged</h3>\n<p>This connector type keeps track of changes based on the <code class=\"language-text\">uSNChanged</code> attribute for the entry. Based on a configured polling interval, the connector connects with the user and password configured in the connection string/data source and checks the list of changes stored by Active Directory. The connector internally maintains the last processed change number (<code class=\"language-text\">uSNChanged</code> value) and this allows for the recovery of all changes that occur even if the connector is down (deliberately or due to failure).</p>\n<p>If capturing the sequence of events is critical, use the DirSync connector instead of USNChanged because it processes events in the order in which they occur instead of prioritizing and processing inserts and updates before deletes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hybrid\">Hybrid</h3>\n<p>This connector type uses a combination of the uSNChanged and DirSync change detection mechanisms. The first time the connector starts, it gets a new cookie and the highest uSNchanged number. When the connector gets a new change (modify or delete), it makes an additional search using the DN of the entry and fetches the entry from AD. The fetched entry contains the <code class=\"language-text\">uSNChanged</code> attribute, so the connector updates the cursor values for both for the cookie and the last processed uSNchanged number.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nIf you are virtualizing and detecting changes from a Global Catalog, then you must use the Active Directory USNChanged changed connector because the Hybrid connector cannot detect change events on sub-domains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the connector restarts, uSNChanged detection catches the entries that have been modified or deleted while the connector was stopped. The LDAP search uses the last processed uSNChanged number to catch up. After the connector processes all entries, it requests a new cookie from AD (not from the cursor) and switches to DirSync change detection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"radiantone-directory-connector\">RadiantOne Directory Connector</h2>\n<p>If you are using the RadiantOne Directory, a persistent cache on a proxy view of a RadiantOne Directory, or a nested persistent cache view (a cached view used in another cached view), the connector type is noted as HDAP trigger automatically and cannot be changed. This is a special trigger mechanism that publishes changes directly into the queue to invoke the synchronization as opposed to requiring a connector component to detect the change.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/image37.png\" alt=\"HDAP Trigger Connector Type\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"directory-connector-failover\">Directory connector failover</h2>\n<p>This section describes the failover mechanism for the LDAP (changelog), Persistent Search and Active Directory connectors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nThe backend servers must be configured for multi-master replication. Please check the vendor documentation for assistance with configuring replication for your backends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The directory connectors leverage the failover servers that have been configured for the data source. When you configure a data source for your backend directory, you need to indicate the list of failover servers in order of priority. When the connector fails over, it uses the failover servers in the order they are listed. See the screen shot below for how to indicate a failover server for the Data Sources from the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<p> <img src=\"Media/image38.png\" alt=\"Configuring Failover Servers for the Backend Directory\"></p>\n<p>If a connection cannot be made to the primary server and the maximum number of retry attempts has been exhausted, the connector connects to the failover servers in the order they are listed. There is no automatic failback, meaning once the primary server is back online, the connector does not automatically go back to it.</p>\n<p>This failover mechanism is supported for Active Directory, OpenDJ, Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition (Sun Directory v7), Oracle Unified Directory (OUD). In addition, any LDAP directory implementing <code class=\"language-text\">cn=changelog</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">replicationCSN</code> attribute or the persistent search control is also supported.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nWhen the Active Directory DirSync connector fails over to another DC replica, the current cursor (cookie) is used. The connector may receive all objects and attributes from the replica instead of just the delta from its last request. Therefore, you may notice the number of entries published by the connector is more than you were expecting. This behavior is dictated by the Active Directory server and is out of the control of the connector. Keep this in mind when you define the Max Retries and Retry Intervals for the connector properties. The smaller the numbers of retries, the higher the chance the connector will fail over and possibly receive all objects and attributes (a full sync) from the domain controller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the Active Directory USNChanged connector, the failover logic leverages the Active Directory replication vectors <code class=\"language-text\">[replUpToDateVector]</code>, and the failover servers configured at the level of the RadiantOne data source associated with Active Directory, in order to determinate which server(s) the connector switches to in case of failure. Since the replication vector contains all domains, in addition to some possibly retired domains, the connector narrows down the list of possible failover candidates to only the ones listed as failover servers in the RadiantOne data source associated with the Active Directory backend. If there are no failover server defined for the data source, all domains in the replication vector are possible candidates for failover.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nWhen defining the RadiantOne data source associated with Active Directory, do not use Host Discovery. You must use the fully qualified machine names for the primary server and failover servers. Do not use IP addresses. Also, it is highly recommended that you list your desired failover servers at the level of the data source. Not only does this make the failover logic more efficient, but it also avoids delays in synchronization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">[replUpToDateVector]</code> definition: The non-replicated attribute <code class=\"language-text\">replUpToDateVector</code> is an optional attribute on the naming context root of every naming context replica.

The list of potential failover servers is stored at each polling interval. When the current server fails, the connector decides to switch to the closest candidate by selecting the server with the maximum timestamp from the up-to-dateness vector. The capture connector's cursor will be assigned the value from the up-to-dateness vector for the failover server. If the closest candidate fails as well, the connector tries with a second closest candidate and so on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nDue to the lack of Active Directory replication for the <code class=\"language-text\">USNChanged</code> attribute, some changes could be missed or replayed on failover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the AD Hybrid connector, the failover process starts when the number of exceptions exceeds either the Maximum Retries on Error or Maximum Retries on Connection Error value. The failover servers are specified in the data source associated with Active Directory. The Active Directory up-to-date vector is used to determine the failover server and the value of the new cursor. If the up-to-date vector is unavailable from the current server, failover is not possible. If this happens, verify that AD replication is correctly configured. After the failover server is found, uSNChanged detection catches the entries that have been modified or deleted since the connector's failure. The LDAP search uses the last processed uSNChanged number to catch up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nDue to the lack of Active Directory replication for the <code class=\"language-text\">USNChanged</code> attribute, some changes could be missed or replayed on failover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the connector processes all entries, it requests a new cookie from Active Directory and switches to DirSync change detection.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"persistent-cache-refresh-capture-connectors-overview"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Persistent Cache Refresh Capture Connectors Overview"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The capture connector configuration dictates the process for detecting changes on the source objects.
