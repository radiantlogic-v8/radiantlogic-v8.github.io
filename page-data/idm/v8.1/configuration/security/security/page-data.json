LDAP Access Control Lists (ACLs) specify which users or groups have permission to perform specific actions on the RadiantOne namespace.

If a user doesn't have permission, the operation is denied and an error message is returned.</p>\n<p>LDAP ACLs work by combining both access control rules and access control instructions.
