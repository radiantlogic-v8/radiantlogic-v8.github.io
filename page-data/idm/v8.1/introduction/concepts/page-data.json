For this reason, it is recommended that you do not export these data sources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"secure-data-connector\">Secure Data Connector</h2>\n<p>Secure Data Connectors are only applicable to RadiantOne deployed as SaaS. They are not offered for self-managed deployments.</p>\n<p>A secure data connector establishes a secure connection between your SaaS service and on-prem identity data sources. This allows RadiantOne to securely retrieve identity-related data from an on-prem environment or across different cloud environments. When you define a data source, the configuration process allows you to define how you connect to the data source. Connections to custom objects that connect to a REST API or web endpoint, for example, typically do not require a secure data connector. On-prem backends, on the other hand, typically require selecting a secure data connector.</p>\n<p>For details about Secure Data Connectors, see: <a href=\"/../../eoc/latest/secure-data-connector/configure-sdc\">add a data connector</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"union\">Union</h2>\n<p>Union is a well-known term in the RDBMS-world and the value of the union operation is key for any federated identity service. Union is essentially the ability to create a list where every user is listed once and only once, even if they appear multiple times in the data stores across the enterprise. User overlap can occur for several different reasons. There could be one user listed numerous times, or multiple users with the same name spread across disparate data silos. The result of a union is a unique list of users that is indexed for each system which enables fast and easy lookups. The reason this capability is critical for an identity service is because it makes the identification of a user more accurate and efficient.</p>\n<p>For example, if you don’t have a single source of users, an application would have to look in all the different data stores across the enterprise to find a particular user. Even if a user is listed in only one store (unless that exact store is already known), an application still needs to locate them, resulting in multiple queries issued (at least one to each source the user could potentially be located in). However, if you have a master index (an “identity hub”), the client application only needs to query this list to locate a user, which results in queries to only the backend stores where the user is located. The more sources involved, the more valuable this global index is. It is this global list that is created and maintained by RadiantOne.</p>\n<p>In cases where the data stores contain user overlap, RadiantOne performs aggregation and correlation, creating a common key to identify users across disparate systems. However, the union operation is still important for data sources that may or may not have identity intersection. If they do not have identity overlap there is no need for correlation, but the function of union is still crucial for building your identity service.</p>\n<p>The diagrams below provide a summary/review of data sources containing duplicate/intersecting identities.</p>\n<p>In the first scenario, the data sources have no overlap of identities. In this scenario the benefits of union would still be important for identity management since a single unique index/list is still required for applications to identify a user for authentication. However, the design effort is a bit easier as no correlation logic is required. An aggregation of sources A, B, and C is sufficient, so the primary design consideration in this case is what hierarchy applications are expecting and to build this namespace accordingly.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 350px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 35.27272727272727%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAHABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEF/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHUokGn/8QAGRAAAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDERIT/9oACAEBAAEFAlD9AHxMU1//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAwEBPwFH/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECIf/aAAgBAgEBPwFYOj//xAAYEAACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIQECMf/aAAgBAQAGPwKWWZp//8QAGRAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACExQVGR/9oACAEBAAE/IWZDTKJDo//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQg+//xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEh/9oACAEDAQE/EAwji//EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIRH/2gAIAQIBAT8QsM1xH//EABoQAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQWH/2gAIAQEAAT8QBIY3015URmYaPYDR2mZn/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"data sources with no overlapping identities\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/f9808e7cfa4a19be2628595779e8576e/aaaf9/Image2.3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f9808e7cfa4a19be2628595779e8576e/c1cfe/Image2.3.jpg 275w,\n/static/f9808e7cfa4a19be2628595779e8576e/aaaf9/Image2.3.jpg 350w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>In cases where there starts to be user overlap (as seen in Sources A and B in the diagram below), the configuration starts to require correlation.

If there is not a single identifier that is common for the overlapping users, then correlation logic is required to determine the match. Correlation links the common users and is required to build a unique list.</p>\n<p>To correlate identities, a logical rule must exist for each data source so that a combination of attributes (eventually transformed) will yield a match for common users. For each source, different attributes can be used to generate the correlation logic.</p>\n<p>To build a virtual view that correlates identities, use the Global Identity Builder. See the <a href=\"../configuration/global-identity-builder/introduction.md\">RadiantOne Global Identity Builder Guide</a> for details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"joins\">Joins</h2>\n<p>Joining is a way to combine information from multiple data sources into a single entry. There are two types of joins in RadiantOne. One type is known as a <a href=\"#regular-join\">regular join</a> and the other is an <a href=\"#extended-join\">extended join</a>. Each is described below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"regular-join\">Regular Join</h3>\n<p>A Regular Join is defined as adding existing attribute(s) from another data source(s) to a virtual entry. The starting point for the join is known as the primary (or main) object. The data sources to be joined are known as secondary (or target) objects. Any object in the RadiantOne namespace can be a primary or secondary object. In RadiantOne, entries representing the same user across all data sources must have a unique identifier (common key) or a set of common identifiers in order to join.

However, this logic is executed inside RadiantOne so caution should be taken to ensure no undesirable effects. It is highly recommended that you engage Radiant Logic Professional Services to write the interception script(s). If you choose to write your own script(s), the Radiant Logic support team might be unable to diagnose problems in a timely manner. This can result in additional consultation fees imposed on the customer related to the time required to assess and certify the script logic. This is beyond the scope of support and falls under Radiant Logic Professional Services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interception scripts can be configured at a <a href=\"../configuration/global-settings/global-interception\">global level</a> (to apply to all root naming contexts configured for the RadiantOne namespace), or for a specific backend (LDAP, Database, Web Services).

They are primarily used to simplify the configuration of access permissions. Managing access permissions for all individuals on a per-user basis can be time-consuming and inefficient. Grouping users and assigning access permissions to the entire group is a better approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authorization-enforcement-point\">Authorization Enforcement Point</h3>\n<p>When it comes to evaluating access permissions/authorization, the notion of enforcement point should be understood. Based on the specific configuration/use case, the enforcement point is the application itself, and/or RadiantOne.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Enforcement:</strong>\r\n<br>Typically, in situations where the application is configured to assign roles to specific groups, it will be the enforcement point for authorization. This is common with Web Access Management (WAM) products. The application searches the directory for the groups and then checks group membership to see if a particular user should have access to a protected resource. In this scenario, RadiantOne only must respond with groups and members, and the application enforces authorization for the resources it protects.</p>\n<p><strong>RadiantOne Enforcement:</strong>\r\n<br><a href=\"06-security#access-control\">Access control checking</a> can be turned on or off at the level of RadiantOne. If access control checking is enabled, every time a user authenticates to RadiantOne, it verifies whether the user (or a group the user is a member of) has permissions to access the entries. It allows or denies access based on permissions that have been defined.</p>\n<p>Both the application and RadiantOne can play a role in authorization enforcement if required. If access control checking is enabled in RadiantOne, it decides whether the service account the application connects to the directory with can see groups or not. Then, after reading the group entries, the application decides whether a particular user can access a resource based on roles that are defined in the application itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"static--dynamic-ldap-groups\">Static &#x26; Dynamic LDAP Groups</h3>\n<p>Group members can be either static (explicit member DN in the group entry) or dynamic (group members are built based on specific criteria). The benefit of dynamic groups is that they are easier to define and manage because all group members do not need to be manually added/removed one at a time. Only a common filter that encompasses all group members needs to be configured. If a user entry changes (and the change impacts an attribute used in a dynamic group) they are automatically added/removed from groups without requiring a change in the group definition. However, the disadvantage of dynamic groups is that not all LDAP directories support them and even fewer LDAP applications can consume them. This is because the application logic must include the ability to not only request a group but be able to evaluate the memberURL attribute which requires them to issue an additional search to the directory to get the list of members.</p>\n<p>The differences between static and dynamic groups are depicted in the diagrams below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.21.jpg\" alt=\"example of static group\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.22.jpg\" alt=\"Example of Traditional LDAP Dynamic Groups\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"groups-supported-by-radiantone\">Groups Supported by RadiantOne</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne can be configured for both static and dynamic LDAP groups (as they are described above). In RadiantOne, static and dynamic LDAP groups are described and configured as user-defined groups. RadiantOne also offers auto-generated groups in which both the group names and members are dynamically created.</p>\n<p>All types of groups can be created with the <a href=\"05-creating-virtual-views#groups-builder\">Groups Builder wizard</a>. This section focuses on the definition of each type.</p>\n<p><strong>User-Defined Groups</strong>\r\n<br>Static group names are explicitly listed for the group entry (just as with “standard” LDAP group entries). A user-defined group may be named anything and have members that are either statically defined or dynamically created based on a specific rule (dynamically assigned group members are similar to “standard” LDAP dynamic groups). The diagram below depicts an example of user-defined groups with dynamic members. In the example, group members are built dynamically based on the department attribute in the user entries. If a user’s department were to change, they would automatically be reflected as a member of the new group. For simplicity, only the member ID is shown in the virtual entry whereas the full user DN is returned (as an LDAP client expects) when these groups are requested.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.23.jpg\" alt=\"User-Defined Groups with Dynamic Members\"></p>\n<p>Static group members are specific user DNs explicitly listed as members for the group entry. Static group members can be any user DN in the virtual directory tree which means they can come from any backend source.</p>\n<p>Dynamic group members are assigned to groups based on rules defined for specific attributes. The attribute values determine which group the member is associated with. First, determine the starting point in the virtual namespace to locate the possible group members. Then, decide which attribute(s) of these entries should be used to determine which group they belong to. For example, if all user entries that contain a department attribute value of “Sales” or “Sales Associate” should be a member of the Sales group, then the LDAP filter used in the rule would look like: (|(departmentNumber=Sales)(departmentNumber=Sales Associate)). Any valid LDAP filter can be used to create the rule for populating group membership.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto-Generated Groups</strong></p>\n<p>With auto-generated groups, group names are determined based on all possible values of a specified user attribute. The attribute values to determine the group names can be pulled from any virtual entries. First, determine the starting point in the virtual namespace to locate entries that contain the attribute you want to base group names on. Then, decide which attribute of these entries contains the possible group names. For example, if all user entries contained a department attribute, possible group names could be determined by creating a unique list of all possible departments. The list is the basis for creating the group names. If all users were associated with one of five different departments (Marketing, Sales, HR, Support, Engineering), then there would be a total of five auto-generated group names based on these values. The group members are determined dynamically based on the value of their department attribute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] The attribute you select to base the auto-generated group names on must be single-valued in the user entries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The diagram below depicts an example of auto-generated groups with both group names and members generated dynamically. In this example, department names are the basis for determining the group names in RadiantOne. This offers an enormous amount of flexibility. If a new department were to appear in the database, a new group would automatically appear in RadiantOne with this new name. Group members are built dynamically based on the department attribute in their entries. If a user’s department were to change, they would automatically be reflected as a member of the new group in RadiantOne. For simplicity, only the member ID is shown in the virtual entry whereas the full user DN will be returned (as an LDAP client expects).</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.24.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-Generated Groups with Dynamic Group Names and Dynamic Members\"></p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"05-creating-virtual-views#groups-builder\">Groups Builder wizard</a> for details on creating both user-defined and auto-generated groups.</p>\n<h2 id=\"metadataschema-extraction\">Metadata/Schema Extraction</h2>\n<p>A main key capability of RadiantOne is metadata/schema extraction. To virtualize each <a href=\"#data-source\">data source</a> the first step is to discover the metadata/schema. This is essential for understanding how each data source stores identities and the related context about the identities. During the schema extraction process, existing objects, attributes and relationships are discovered. This metadata allows RadiantOne to create a global common model of all objects and is the core/basis for defining virtual views. This entire process is depicted in the diagram below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.25.jpg\" alt=\"Metadata/Schema Discovery and View Definition Global Process\"></p>\n<p>The schema extraction process can be launched from the Main Control Panel > Context Builder tab > Schema Manager sub-tab.</p>\n<h2 id=\"delegated-authentication\">Delegated Authentication</h2>\n<p>Since all data sources store user and password information differently (and use varying encryption mechanisms), it is important for RadiantOne to be able to delegate the bind to the underlying source when needed. The first step is to build a federated namespace from all sources where user information resides.</p>\n<p>After the federated namespace has been built, an application can query RadiantOne and unknowingly be able to search across numerous sources of user information.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.26.jpg\" alt=\"Example of a Federated Namespace\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"authentication--client-issues-the-bind-dn\">Authentication – Client Issues the Bind DN</h3>\n<p>When a user logs in with a username and password, some applications send a search request to find (“identify”) the user’s entry. Once the user is in the RadiantOne namespace, the entry is returned to the application (the entry contains the virtual DN for the user, which is where the user exists in the RadiantOne namespace). The application then issues a bind request using the virtual DN and the password that was entered during the login process. For clarity, this process is described in two steps depicted in the diagrams below: Identification and Credentials Checking.</p>\n<p>In the example below, the backend source is an LDAP directory that is mounted in the RadiantOne namespace using a proxy configuration. Again, there are two steps in the process: Identification and Credentials Checking.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.27.jpg\" alt=\"Identification Step\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.28.jpg\" alt=\"Credentials Checking Step\"></p>\n<p>If the underlying source does not understand an LDAP bind operation (i.e. a relational database), RadiantOne can be customized to encrypt the password that was passed from the client using the appropriate algorithm and then compare that value with the value stored in the database (the attribute that has been mapped to userPassword) to decide whether the bind succeeds or fails. This encryption is performed via an interception script. As mentioned before, the entire authentication process happens in two steps: Identification and Credentials Checking. They are depicted below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.29.jpg\" alt=\"Identification Step\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.30.jpg\" alt=\"Credentials Checking\"></p>\n<p>A template for the interception script is provided and can be customized to use the needed encryption algorithm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authentication--client-issues-a-user-id-only\">Authentication – Client Issues a User ID Only</h3>\n<p>If a client application only sends a user ID to RadiantOne, and is not configured to first search for the user and then issue a bind with the full DN, RadiantOne can be configured with User ID to DN Mappings (to first find the DN and then issue the bind to the appropriate backend source). For details on configuring User ID to DN Mappings please see <a href=\"interception#user-to-dn-mapping\">User to DN Mapping</a>. The following diagram depicts the process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThe Identification and Credentials Checking steps still happen, however, they are both performed by RadiantOne (first find the user, then Bind to check credentials).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image..jpg\" alt=\"Entire Authentication Process using User ID to DN Mapping Rules\"></p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"concepts-introduction"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Concepts Introduction"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The following are concepts that you should understand in order to configure and administer RadiantOne Identity Data Management."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"ul","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#data-source"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Data Source"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#secure-data-connector"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Secure Data Connector"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#union"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Union"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#identity-correlation"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Identity Correlation"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#joins"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Joins"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#bind-order"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Bind Order"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#computed-attributes"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Computed Attributes"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#interception-scripts"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Interception Scripts"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#groups"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Groups"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#metadataschema-extraction"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Schema Extraction"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#delegated-authentication"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Delegated Authentication"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"data-source"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Data Source"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A data source in RadiantOne represents the connection to a backend.
