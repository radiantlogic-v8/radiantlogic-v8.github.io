This means RadiantOne performance is impacted if swap space starts to be used.</p>\n<p>The setting that controls how often the swap file is used is called swappiness. A swappiness setting of zero means that the disk will be avoided unless absolutely necessary (you run out of memory). Swap should be disabled if possible (/etc/fstab) or configured to prevent swapping under normal usage (set vm.swappiness to a value &#x3C;=20 which is the percentage of RAM left before the system starts to swap).
