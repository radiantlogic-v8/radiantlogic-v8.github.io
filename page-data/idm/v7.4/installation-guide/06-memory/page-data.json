Complex aggregations for processing some virtual directory requests against multiple data sources may temporarily use extra memory. You should keep this in consideration in addition to the estimates provided in this section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By default, RadiantOne FID memory expands up to ¼ of the machine memory. For example, if the machine had 16 GB, then the memory would expand to use at most 4 GB. Once the memory requirements are known for your deployment, ensure the minimum and maximum memory allocations are the same to prevent the heavy process of heap resizing at runtime. You can indicate a minimum (-Xms) and maximum amount (-Xmx) value for the JVM process instead of leveraging this automated expansion. For details on configuring memory size, see the RadiantOne Deployment and Tuning Guide.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIt is recommended to keep the maximum memory (-Xmx) under 32 GB to ensure the JVM uses compressed oops as a performance enhancement. If this is exceeded, the pointers switch to ordinary object pointers which grow in size, are more CPU-intensive and less efficient. Also, -Xms and -Xmx should be set to the same value to help avoid the performance-costly process of garbage collection from happening too frequently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIt is also important to note that the number of cached entries and indexed attributes configured for memory cache (if used) affect the RadiantOne FID memory usage. The number of cached entries is relevant for memory cache (entry and query). This is the number of entries to be stored in main memory. The default size is 5000 entries. The entry cache is populated as requests are sent to RadiantOne FID. This main memory stores the most recently used entries. Indexed attributes is relevant for memory cache (entry level). This is a list of indexed attributes. The default size is 1000 pages, which means there are, at most, 1000 index pages for each attribute you have indexed. For more details on memory cache, please see the RadiantOne Deployment and Tuning Guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The memory requirements for persistent cache or Universal Directory (HDAP) stores varies depending on how many entries are stored and can be calculated with: <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;size of LDIF file containing all entries> x 2 = &lt;MEMORY></code></p>\n<p>E.G. 1M entries (~1KB each) = 1GB LDIF file x 2 = 2GB memory to store this in a Universal Directory (HDAP) store.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If your deployment contains a lot of virtual views (a lot of metadata), ZooKeeper can run out of memory, especially during periods where additional cluster nodes are added and the existing configuration must be synchronized to the new nodes. To check the size of the ZooKeeper data, view the folder size located at &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/apps/zookeeper/data/version-2. For large amounts of metadata (e.g. 3GB), ZooKeeper memory should be increased (e.g. -Xmx5g would increase it to 5GB). ZooKeeper memory size can be set in &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/bin/advanced/runZooKeeperBlocking.bat file. An example of setting the memory to 5GB is shown below:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">\"%RLI_JHOME%\\bin\\java\" –Xmx5g -cp \"%ZOO_CP%\"</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">\"com.rli.zookeeper.commands.ZooKeeperServerWrapper\"</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">\"%RLI_RHOME%\\apps\\zookeeper\\conf\\zoo.cfg\"</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Task Scheduler requires approximately 1 GB to schedule tasks. The actual tasks themselves each run inside their own JVM. For cache initialization containing a large number of entries (e.g. 1 million) it is recommended you manually define the memory used by the task to at least 8GB. This speeds up the cache initialization. For more details on Tasks and how to tune the JVM, please see the System Administration Guide.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may use utilities such as sar on Linux systems or the Windows Task Manager to measure physical memory used by the RadiantOne processes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sizing-memory-for-the-operating-system\">Sizing Memory for the Operating System</h2>\n<p>Estimating the base amount of memory needed to run the underlying operating system must be done empirically, as operating system memory requirements vary widely based on the specifics of the system configuration.
