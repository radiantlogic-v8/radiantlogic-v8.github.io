These steps only apply to updating your existing RadiantOne v7.4 version with a new minor release/patch of RadiantOne v7.4.X.  These steps are not relevant for major upgrades (i.e. upgrading from v7.2 or v7.3).</p>\n<h2 id=\"preparing-for-the-patch\">Preparing for the Patch</h2>\n<p>Once you have stopped all RadiantOne services, make a backup copy of your entire &#x3C;RLI_HOME> folder.</p>\n<p>If you have deployed an external ZooKeeper ensemble, make a backup copy of the entire &#x3C;ZooKeeper_Home> folder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"retrieving-the-update-files\">Retrieving the Update Files</h2>\n<p>The RadiantOne files are located at: <a href=\"https://radiantlogicinc246.sharefile.com/i/i1bc2de34c6e42bba\">https://radiantlogicinc246.sharefile.com/i/i1bc2de34c6e42bba</a></p>\n<p>After you create an account, log in and navigate to: <code class=\"language-text\">/update_installers/7.4/&lt;version_to_update_to></code>.

If you have a blue-green deployment, where you have an extra set of machines to install and test the patch, make sure it is running the same RadiantOne version as the active environment. Then, if needed, migrate over the current configuration from the active environment (using &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\apps\\migration\\migrate.bat/.sh). Finally, run the update in the test environment using the procedure below. After all tests pass, switch your load balancer to direct traffic to the updated environment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For cluster deployments, update all RadiantOne FID follower and follower-only nodes first. Update the RadiantOne FID leader node last. After the node is patched, it is important to ensure that all needed services are back up and running prior to patching the next node.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have backed up your &#x3C;RadiantOne_Installation> folder.</li>\n<li>(Optional) to gracefully scale down, drain any open connections for your load balancer to the RadiantOne node you are updating. See your vendor documentation for configuring connection draining for your load balancer.</li>\n<li>Close any open RadiantOne applications.</li>\n<li>Stop any running services. All possible (default) service names are as follows. Some might not be applicable to your deployment.<br>\r\nZooKeeper\r\n<br>RadiantOne DB Access Logger\r\n<br>RadiantOne FID (vds_server)\r\n<br>RadiantOne FID Management Console (vds_server)\r\n<br>\r\nProcess Explorer (on Windows) can be used to check the handles on the RadiantOne JVM executables to confirm all applications are stopped. Search for handles on \"java\" and you can see every process that has a handle on a java process. For Linux, you can use something like ps aux | grep \"java\" to get a list of Java processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apply the RadiantOne patch with either the web installer, or from command line.</p>\n<h3 id=\"applying-the-patch-using-the-web-interface\">Applying the Patch Using the Web Interface</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to your RadiantOne installation /bin folder (e.g. C:\\radiantone\\vds\\bin). Run setup.bat (.sh on Linux). If on Windows, right-click and Run As Administrator. This launches the Web Installation process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click Choose File and navigate to the location where you copied the .zip (.tar.gz) file associated with the new RadiantOne version and click OK.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
