This is the process to stage the backend data in persistent cache. Then, as a second step, create a virtual view using the cache image as the data source. The parent virtual view should be what is configured with the attribute mappings, computed attributes, joins...etc. This data staging and virtual view layering methodology works well for RDBMS and custom backend data source (e.g. Azure AD, Okta, Salesforce...etc.) that are not as performant as directories for search queries. Keep this in mind as you read through the general view design sections below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nYou can also stage Active Directory and LDAP backends in persistent cache, if these backends are unreliable, or performance needs to be optimized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"general-virtual-view-design\">General Virtual View Design</h2>\n<p>A directory tree is organized in a hierarchy, so that entries in a directory can be referred to by their name relative to the structure of the tree. Within a tree, there is only one namespace for all the entries contained within. Thus, every element of the tree can be located by a distinguished name, one that is unique to that entry.</p>\n<p>When designing your directory tree, it is usually recommended that you adopt a relatively simple naming structure. Obviously, the naming structure should be dependent upon what the application that is consuming the data expects to see. Therefore, the approach you should take when creating your tree (either using one of the RadiantOne Wizards or on your own) is to define the simplest tree that meets your application’s needs.</p>\n<p>The following sections discuss different design  onsiderations for creating your namespace.</p>\n<h3 id=\"design-considerations\">Design Considerations</h3>\n<p>The main design considerations can be categorized by the two different security functions addressed by the RadiantOne platform which are authentication and authorization.</p>\n<h4 id=\"for-authentication\">For Authentication</h4>\n<p>For authentication there are three areas to consider: How to handle overlapping identities (if applicable), if there are overlapping identities what should be the bind order, and finally, what object class and attributes should be associated with the target virtual identity.</p>\n<h5 id=\"overlapping-identities\">Overlapping Identities</h5>\n<p>If there is no identity overlap, then a simple aggregation of all data sources is generally sufficient.</p>\n<p>If there is identity overlap, then correlation logic must be defined. Correlation of identities can be expressed in the following simplified example.</p>\n<p>An LDAP Directory, Active Directory and an HR database contain different information about users. Some users are in both sources, and some are not. For this example, focusing on a single overlapping user, it is known that you can identify common users across LDAP and Active Directory by comparing uid to sAMAccountName. You can identify common users across Active Directory and the HR database by comparing employeeID to EID. This example is depicted in the diagram below where the order of upload to create the global profile list is LDAP directory, then Active Directory, followed by the HR database. The upload order is important for correlation rules. See the <a href=\"/global-identity-builder-guide/introduction\">RadiantOne Global Identity Builder Guide</a> for details.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 623px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 53.45454545454545%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Example of Correlation\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a0b9afa7c916e0edd136b7eb6cf79f84/a8723/Image3.1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a0b9afa7c916e0edd136b7eb6cf79f84/c1cfe/Image3.1.jpg 275w,\n/static/a0b9afa7c916e0edd136b7eb6cf79f84/67061/Image3.1.jpg 550w,\n/static/a0b9afa7c916e0edd136b7eb6cf79f84/a8723/Image3.1.jpg 623w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 1: Example of Correlation</p>\n<h5 id=\"bind-order\">Bind Order</h5>\n<p>As discussed above, if there is identity overlap, correlation rules must be defined. After, RadiantOne generates a unique list of users in addition to maintaining the reference link (location) to all the sources the identity is located in. With this information, RadiantOne can perform credentials checking against the data sources of your choice in a pre-defined order. The diagram below depicts an example. The database is configured with bind order 1. Therefore, RadiantOne attempts the bind there first. If the bind fails against the database, the LDAP directory receives the bind request (as per the configuration). If the bind were to fail again, Active Directory would receive the bind request. If all sources fail, the client receives a bind failure error from RadiantOne FID.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62.18181818181818%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Bind Order Example\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/46373d94d23361fe1b1d5c16eb74d206/b966c/Image3.2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/46373d94d23361fe1b1d5c16eb74d206/c1cfe/Image3.2.jpg 275w,\n/static/46373d94d23361fe1b1d5c16eb74d206/67061/Image3.2.jpg 550w,\n/static/46373d94d23361fe1b1d5c16eb74d206/b966c/Image3.2.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2: Bind Order Example</p>\n<h5 id=\"object-and-attribute-mapping\">Object and Attribute Mapping</h5>\n<p>Providing schema compatibility between the application and data source has been a source of pain for any enterprise working with large sets of data on one side, and providing support for new applications on the other. RadiantOne addresses these issues by taking existing schemas (from multiple sources), and mapping them into a common schema which is delivered to the application in a format it understands and expects. Objects and attributes mapping is a key component for addressing the challenges of authentication and authorization.</p>\n<p>After connections have been established to the underlying data sources, the next design decision is to map the objects and attributes to a common schema. As mentioned previously, the only way applications can search across the RadiantOne namespace for user accounts contained in a variety of different underlying systems is if all the underlying schemas are mapped to a global schema. This way, an application can search for users based on one common identifier (uid for example), and find the account no matter what the actual underlying source uses as the identifier. RadiantOne FID is responsible for translating the request to\r\nsearch the underlying source appropriately.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 473px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 60.36363636363637%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Object Class Mapping Example\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/9fa7eb415be04c6b5cfd0df4fde3c54f/1df45/Image3.3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9fa7eb415be04c6b5cfd0df4fde3c54f/c1cfe/Image3.3.jpg 275w,\n/static/9fa7eb415be04c6b5cfd0df4fde3c54f/1df45/Image3.3.jpg 473w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 3: Object Class Mapping Example</p>\n<h4 id=\"for-authorization\">For Authorization</h4>\n<p>For authorization there are two areas to consider: groups-based authorization and attribute-based authorization.</p>\n<h5 id=\"groups-based-authorization\">Groups-Based Authorization</h5>\n<p>There are two approaches for integrating groups into the RadiantOne namespace: Aggregation of existing groups or auto-generation/computation of new virtual groups. Regardless of the design approach, you must also consider how to map the group to the target object class and attributes so applications understand how to locate the groups they are looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>Objects and Attribute Mapping for Groups</strong></p>\n<p>One of the main design considerations for groups-based authorization is to analyze what object class and attributes applications are expecting for locating group entries in the virtual directory. Some applications can be configured to search for groups that match a number of different possible object classes (group, groupOfUniqueNames...etc.) and membership attributes (member, uniqueMember...etc.). Others may expect a very specific object class and attributes. Therefore, you must define a mapping between the group object class and attribute that exists in the underlying directory and the ones your application expects to find.

This is the\r\nbecause RadiantOne FID searches the underlying directory tree for the group at ou=people,dc=ad,dc=domain and there are no groups located here. In order for RadiantOne FID to be able to retrieve the group entry from the underlying directory, the base DN would have to be configured to point to dc=ad,dc=domain.</p>\n<p>Therefore, a design consideration you need to be aware of is where your base DN parameter points to in the data source configuration. If during the initial configuration of the data source, you did not set the base DN to an appropriate location, you can easily change the data source definition in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Server Backend section.</p>\n<p><strong>Virtual Groups</strong></p>\n<p>For added flexibility, RadiantOne FID is able to generate groups dynamically. This means that both group names and members can be created on-the-fly based on certain criteria. For defining group names, there are two options: setting a user-defined name or auto-generating the group names based on a user attribute.</p>\n<p>With user-defined group names, the members may be either listed explicitly or generated dynamically based on an LDAP filter. With auto-generated group names, both the group names and the members are generated dynamically. More information about each option is described below.</p>\n<p>User-Defined Groups</p>\n<p>User-defined group names are explicitly listed for the group entry. A user-defined group may be named anything and have members that are either explicitly defined or dynamically created based on a specific rule. The diagram below depicts an example of user-defined groups with dynamic members. In the example, group members are built dynamically based on the department attribute in the user entries. If a user’s department were to change, they would automatically be reflected as a member of the new group in the virtual directory. For simplicity, only the member ID is shown in the RadiantOne entry whereas in reality the full user DN is returned (as an LDAP client expects) when these groups are requested.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.72727272727273%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Group Names Pre-defined with Dynamic Members Example\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/cbffc334655a78ee878690aaf840c228/b966c/Image3.7.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cbffc334655a78ee878690aaf840c228/c1cfe/Image3.7.jpg 275w,\n/static/cbffc334655a78ee878690aaf840c228/67061/Image3.7.jpg 550w,\n/static/cbffc334655a78ee878690aaf840c228/b966c/Image3.7.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 7: Group Names Pre-defined with Dynamic Members Example</p>\n<p>Static group members are specific user DNs explicitly listed as members for the group entry. Any user DN in the virtual directory can be assigned to a user-defined group. Static group members can be any user DN in the virtual directory tree which means they can come from any backend source.</p>\n<p>Dynamic group members are assigned to groups based on rules defined for specific attributes. The attribute values determine which group the member is associated with. First, determine the starting point in the RadiantOne namespace to locate the possible group members. Then, decide which attribute(s) of these entries should be used to determine which group they belong to. For example, if all user entries that contain a department attribute value of “Sales” or “Sales Associate” should be a member of the Sales group, then the LDAP filter used in the rule would look like: (|(departmentNumber=Sales)(departmentNumber=Sales Associate)). Any valid LDAP filter can be used to create the rule for populating group membership.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto-Generated Groups</strong></p>\n<p>Auto-generated groups have names that are generated based on attribute values for specific user entries. The attribute values to determine the group names can be pulled from any virtual entries. First, determine the starting point in the virtual tree to locate entries that contain the\r\nattribute you want to base group names on. Then, decide which attribute of these entries contains the possible group names. For example, if all user entries contained a department attribute, possible group names could be determined by creating a unique list of all possible departments. The list is the basis for creating the group names. If all users were associated with one of five different departments (Marketing, Sales, HR, Support, Engineering), then there would be a total of five auto-generated group names based on these values. The group members are determined dynamically based on the value of their department attribute.</p>\n<p>The diagram below depicts an example of groups with both group names and members auto-generated. In this example, department names in the database are the basis for determining the group names in the virtual directory. This offers an enormous amount of flexibility. If a new department were to appear in the database, a new group would automatically appear in RadiantOne FID with this new name. Group members are built dynamically based on the department attribute in their entries. If a user’s department were to change, they would automatically be reflected as a member of the new group in the virtual directory. For simplicity, only the member ID is shown in the virtual entry whereas in reality the full user DN is returned (as an LDAP client expects).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 521px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 58.54545454545455%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Auto-generated Groups\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/0964e7036d76626b1bf0eea9b7fbbbad/8ba14/Image3.8.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0964e7036d76626b1bf0eea9b7fbbbad/c1cfe/Image3.8.jpg 275w,\n/static/0964e7036d76626b1bf0eea9b7fbbbad/8ba14/Image3.8.jpg 521w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 8: Auto-generated Groups</p>\n<h5 id=\"attributes-based-authorization\">Attributes-Based Authorization</h5>\n<p>The term dynamic join means that RadiantOne FID performs the aggregation of attributes from common identities on-the-fly as applications request a particular entry.

Therefore, a common design consideration is determining how you want to handle cases where the same attributes (same names) are found in multiple data sources. Options include:</p>\n<p>Have RadiantOne return multi-valued attributes when joining across data sources where attribute names are the same but the values are different.</p>\n<p>E.g. join between an Active Directory and Sun Java Directory would yield two different values for phone number. In the joined entry, RadiantOne would return phone number as a multi-valued attribute containing the values from both Active Directory and Sun.</p>\n<p>Have RadiantOne only return attributes in the joined entry that are declared as authoritative.</p>\n<p>E.g. join between an Active Directory and Sun Java Directory would yield two different values for phone number. Declare the phone number in Active Directory as authoritative. In the joined entry, RadiantOne FID would only return the phone number from Active Directory. In cases where there was no phone number in Active Directory, the one from Sun Java Directory could be returned (or decide to return nothing at all for phone number).</p>\n<p>These options are described in more detail in the example below.</p>\n<p>If a unique identifier exists (or can be defined based on a logical rule) to relate identities from one data source to another, then RadiantOne can easily join the corresponding entries together and return one complete identity. For instance, if a company uses an employee identification number in both its enterprise directory and its HR database, RadiantOne can match the value from each to form an aggregated entry with the attributes from both.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nIf a single unique identifier does not exist across the sources, the <a href=\"getting-started-with-radiantone.md#global-identity-builder\">Global Identity Builder</a> can be used to define correlation rules and create a common identifier that RadiantOne FID can use for the join.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the example shown below, there is an Enterprise Directory and an HR database, which each contain some information about Aaron Wilson. There is an employee ID number which is found in both sources. RadiantOne uses this attribute’s value to form the join between the two underlying data sources to make a single identity with information from both.</p>\n<p>Notice that the phone number stored in the HR database is different than the phone number in the Enterprise Directory. Some analysis is needed to determine how RadiantOne FID should comprise the joined entry. Some possibilities include:</p>\n<p>The Enterprise Directory’s phone attributes are known to be out of date and unreliable. Aaron’s unified identity should only use the HR Database’s phone number. In this case, the join can be configured to return the HR database phone number as authoritative. An example of this is shown in the diagram below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 400px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.9090909090909%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDBf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAdudmDEL/8QAFxAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAv/aAAgBAQABBQLbmcN0hCH/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAZEAACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAgIWH/2gAIAQEABj8CzTEiu1//xAAZEAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhEHH/2gAIAQEAAT8hVK+E32a7HErcQ7KT/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABDPD//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQUf/aAAgBAwEBPxBHZ//EABgRAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQESEx/9oACAECAQE/ECupsf/EABwQAQEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAJExQSFRYf/aAAgBAQABPxBcXwACpe58yqQoQR33zvBwklE9OL0NwLi7z//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Join Example Using Attribute Authority\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/7b27cc7d9aac7dbcb09c3fc94e4da983/a6407/Image3.10.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7b27cc7d9aac7dbcb09c3fc94e4da983/c1cfe/Image3.10.jpg 275w,\n/static/7b27cc7d9aac7dbcb09c3fc94e4da983/a6407/Image3.10.jpg 400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 10: Join Example Using Attribute Authority</p>\n<p>The Enterprise Directory phone numbers are for work phone numbers, and the HR Database tracks home phone numbers.

The goal is to design the views of data that applications expect to see. Some applications may work best with a very hierarchical view of data (for delegated administration for example), while a flat view works well for others (a unique list of users for authentication as an example).</p>\n<p>There are two aspects to focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The structure of the virtual view (how deep of a hierarchy you need).</li>\n<li>The content of the virtual view (which attributes need to be available for the application to provide the expected service)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, these are dependent upon the clients that consume the RadiantOne service.</p>\n<p>After analyzing the needs of the applications that consume the RadiantOne service, the next thing is to determine where the data that is required to build the virtual views resides. Is the information inside a database (one table? multiple tables?), inside a directory (one or many containers?), inside custom data sources (reachable as a web service?), or does not exist yet (need to build attributes on-the-fly or store new attributes required by the application).</p>\n<p>After the primary analysis of your environment and the requirements of client applications, metadata (attributes and relationships) discovery and enhancement (data mapping and\r\nanalysis) are the next steps.</p>\n<p>Once all data source schemas have been extracted, staged in persistent cache (if needed) and enhanced, you are ready to begin building the views that applications will consume.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne offers many tools to create virtual views. They can be built using the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace tab or <a href=\"getting-started-with-radiantone.md#identity-service-wizards\">Identity Service Wizards</a> (accessible on the Main Control Panel > Wizards tab) or the Main Control Panel > Context Builder tab. For complete details on Context Builder, please see the <a href=\"/context-builder-guide/introduction\">RadiantOne Context Builder Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>The sections below introduce possible types of virtual views you can build from LDAP and database backends. Building virtual views with objects from many different heterogeneous backends is also discussed.</p>\n<h5 id=\"virtual-views-from-ldap-backends\">Virtual Views from LDAP Backends</h5>\n<p>An LDAP backend is any LDAP-accessible directory. This includes, but is not limited to, Oracle Directory (formerly Sun Java Directory), Active Directory, Novell eDirectory, OpenLDAP, and IBM Tivoli Directory Server.</p>\n<p><strong>Flatten Existing LDAP Hierarchies</strong></p>\n<p>Flat virtual views are based on an object class in the LDAP Backend. For example, if an existing LDAP directory tree is hierarchical and user entries are spread across many branches, the virtual view can contain the complete list of users consolidated into one flat list. All entries associated with the configured class are displayed in the virtual view at runtime no matter where the entry exists in the actual LDAP backend.

For details on content objects, please see the <a href=\"/context-builder-guide/introduction\">RadiantOne Context Builder Guide</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Context-Driven Hierarchies Based on Existing Metadata</strong></p>\n<p>The hierarchy builder utility assists you in modeling context-driven virtual views based on the existing metadata in your directory. This means that the hierarchy of the virtual view is based on attributes of an LDAP object class. Attributes from any object extracted with the Schema Manager can be used to build a virtual directory hierarchy (if all entries have a value for this attribute). This is an easy way to turn a relatively flat LDAP directory tree into a hierarchical structure.</p>\n<p>The following four figures provide an example of the process. For specific details on the configuration steps, see Hierarchy Builder in the <a href=\"/context-builder-guide/introduction\">RadiantOne Context Builder Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>The hierarchy shown below is an example of an LDAP directory tree and three detailed user entries.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 510px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 53.81818181818182%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Example LDAP Entries\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/71292f18c18e4f952702f16d743d57d4/25ef5/Image3.14.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/71292f18c18e4f952702f16d743d57d4/c1cfe/Image3.14.jpg 275w,\n/static/71292f18c18e4f952702f16d743d57d4/25ef5/Image3.14.jpg 510w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 14: Example LDAP Entries</p>\n<p>The first step in building a virtual view is to extract the schema information using Schema Manager.

For details on building context-based virtual hierarchies, please see <a href=\"/context-builder-guide/view-designer\">View Designer in the Context Builder Guide</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Virtual Views Combining Objects from Heterogeneous Sources</strong></p>\n<p>Virtual views that are comprised of objects and attributes from multiple heterogeneous data sources are built using links and/or joins. Whenever a virtual view needs to contain information from more than one data source, the design options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extend the entries from the primary source with attributes from other sources that the same users exist in. This is accomplished using <a href=\"#joins\">joins</a>.</li>\n<li>Condition the virtual hierarchy based on a relationship (common key) between objects across data sources. This is accomplished using <a href=\"#links\">links</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"joins\">Joins</h4>\n<p>Joins are used as a way to extend a primary set of entries with attributes from other objects. In general, joins are a way to provide additional context at the level of an entry. Take a person entry as an example; the more attributes available in the person’s entry offers more context about that person (personal information, projects they are working on, who their manager is...etc.).</p>\n<p>With RadiantOne, there are two categories of joins:</p>\n<p>Regular Join – extend entries with existing attributes from multiple data sources.

The link parameter conditions the subtree based on an attribute of the parent object (typically the primary key, but could also be a candidate key). The value of this attribute must match an attribute in the tree to be mounted. An example is used to describe the benefit of using a link with a parameter.

Access controls established in RadiantOne take precedence so that security is consistent across the entire namespace. When RadiantOne redirects LDAP queries to an existing directory service, the access controls from the existing directory can still be used if desired, leaving existing security designs intact.</p>\n<h3 id=\"access-controls\">Access Controls</h3>\n<p>Access permissions are configured from the RadiantOne Main Control Panel and can be based on users, groups, specific tree branches, pre-defined users or IP addresses. The design decisions to address are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Target DN: where in the directory tree you want the access permission to apply to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Target Scope: the depth in the tree where the access rule should apply (one level below the target, entire subtree below the target, or just the defined target entry itself).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type: The permissions you are setting is either a grant or deny.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Target Filter: You can add an LDAP filter condition on the target resource (location) to protect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Target Attributes: The rule can indicate “equal to” (=) or “not equal to (!=). Select the desired condition in the drop-down list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Operations: Read, Search, Add, Delete, Compare, Write, Self Write, Proxy, Move (current DN), Move (future DN)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apply To: Who the access permission is applying to: specific IP addresses, public, all authenticated users, self, parent, users, groups, or users associated in a specific tree/branch.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"ssl-tls-and-mutual-authentication\">SSL, TLS, and Mutual Authentication</h3>\n<p>To keep identity information private over network links, RadiantOne supports TLS. TLS enables client computers to establish encrypted sessions with the RadiantOne server, so that all network communication stays private.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne also offers the ability to force mutual authentication which means the RadiantOne service must verify the client is who they claim to be (via their certificate) before allowing them to establish a secure connection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"related-material-1\">Related Material</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/sys-admin-guide/01-introduction\">RadiantOne System Administration Guide</a> sections titled: SSL, Security, and Access Controls</li>\n</ul>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"virtual-view-design"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Virtual View Design"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"staging-backend-data"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Staging Backend Data"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If the identity data sources you plan on integrating with RadiantOne are anything other than LDAP directories or Active Directories, the recommended approach is to first create a basic virtual view that has no specific attribute mappings, computed attributes, joins...etc. and then configure the virtual view with persistent cache and the desired refresh strategy.
