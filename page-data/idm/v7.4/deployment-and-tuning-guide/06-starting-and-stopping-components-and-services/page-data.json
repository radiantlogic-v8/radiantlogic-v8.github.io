It is recommended that it runs as a service in production environments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nWhen deploying in a cluster, the first node in the cluster is the leader node. No matter how you choose to start the process, the one on the leader node should be started first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"from-main-control-panel\">From Main Control Panel</h3>\n<p>After starting the Control Panel, login with the super user (e.g. default cn=directory manager) along with the password you selected during the install of RadiantOne.</p>\n<p>You can start the RadiantOne service from the Dashboard tab if it is not configured as a service. If it is, you must start/stop the service directly from the OS services window.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf the RadiantOne service is started from the Dashboard tab, the process is killed when the user logs off the machine. Start RadiantOne as a Windows service to avoid this problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"as-a-windows-service\">As a Windows Service</h3>\n<p>Once you have tested your virtual views and are ready to deploy your architecture, the RadiantOne service can be configured to start as a Windows service. Configure it as a Windows service with the following steps. Perform these steps on the RadiantOne leader node first (if you are running in a cluster). If you are not running in a cluster, perform these steps on any server in your classic architecture.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure that the RadiantOne service is stopped if it is currently running.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\bin\\windows.service directory. You will find fid-server-service-install.bat and fid-server-service-uninstall.bat. These files install RadiantOne as a service and uninstall the service respectively.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf you are running RadiantOne on Windows 7, 2008, 2012, or 2016 you should execute fid-server-service-install or fid-server-service-uninstall as an administrator. To do so, right-click on the file and choose Run as administrator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Execute the fid-server-service-install.bat file. A command window opens briefly and then closes. Check your services window (refresh if it was already open) and you should see a new service for the RadiantOne Server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the RadiantOne service (be sure to start the leader node first if you are deploying a cluster).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) If a local ZooKeeper is deployed (instead of an external ZooKeeper ensemble), reboot the machine to ensure ZooKeeper also starts as a service along with the RadiantOne service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repeat steps 1-5 on all nodes (if deploying in a cluster) or on all other servers if deployed in a classic architecture.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"uninstalling-the-windows-service\">Uninstalling the Windows Service</h4>\n<p>To uninstall the Windows service, stop the service and execute &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\ \\bin\\windows.service\\fid-server-service-uninstall.bat. The process of uninstalling RadiantOne as a Windows service does not update the setting in ZooKeeper. Therefore, the Dashboard tab in the Main Control Panel does not properly display the stop/start options for the RadiantOne service since it assumes it is still configured to run as a service. To address this, manually update the asAService property in ZooKeeper. There are two methods you can choose from.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>From the Main Control Panel, switch to <a href=\"00-preface#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>. Go to the Settings tab and navigate to Server Front End -> Advanced. Uncheck the Run as a Window Service option and save the configuration. Restart the Control Panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use the vdsconfig utility to update the asAService property to false. Below is an example. After running the command, restart the Control Panel.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>C:\\radiantone\\vds\\bin>vdsconfig.bat set-property -name asAService -value false\r\n<br> Using RLI home : C:\\radiantone\\vds\r\n<br> Using Java home : C:\\radiantone\\vds\\jdk\\jre\r\n<br> 0 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManagerConnectionStateListener - Curator connection state change: CONNECTED\r\n<br> 9 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManagerConnectionStateListener - VDS-ZK connection state changed: CONNECTED\r\n<br> 9 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManager - ZooManager connection state changed: CONNECTED\r\n<br> Previous value: true\r\n<br> New value: false\r\n<br> Configuration has been updated successfully.</p>\n<h3 id=\"as-a-linux-daemon\">As a LINUX Daemon</h3>\n<p>On UNIX platforms, the RadiantOne service can be started with $RLI_HOME/bin/runVDSServer.sh.</p>\n<p>Once you have tested your configuration and are ready to deploy your architecture, the RadiantOne service can be configured to start as a Linux Daemon. The startup script is located in $RLI_HOME/bin/rc.d (for init.d scripts) and $RLI_HOME/bin/system.d (for system.d scripts). Documents to assist with the configuration of the service are located at $RLI_HOME/bin/rc.d/readme.txt (for init.d scripts) and $RLI_HOME/bin/system.d/readme.txt (for system.d scripts).</p>\n<p>Assuming you are logged into your LINUX machine, use the following commands on the leader node first if you are running in a cluster. Once the daemon is running on the leader node, run the following commands on the follower/follower-only nodes:</p>\n<p>For init.d scripts:</p>\n<p>sudo cp $RLI_HOME/bin/rc.d/vds /etc/init.d/\r\n<br> sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/vds\r\n<br> sudo chkconfig --add vds   #To automatically configure the vds init script for the configured runlevels (3 and 5, these are defined in the vds script).

You can configure it as a Windows service with the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the %RLI_HOME%\\bin\\windows.service directory. Control-panel-service-install and control-panel-service-uninstall are located here.

To do so, right-click on the file and choose Run as administrator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verify that the web server is stopped. For example, try going to: <a href=\"http://localhost:7070\">http://localhost:7070</a> (this is using the default port, if you set a different port during the RadiantOne install, you should use it here). If this page doesn’t return anything, the web server probably isn’t running. If it is running you can stop it with: &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/bin/stopWebAppserver.bat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Execute the control-panel-service-install file. A command window opens briefly and then exits.
