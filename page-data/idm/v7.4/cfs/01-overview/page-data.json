FID in turn delegates authentication to the appropriate data store, and gathers attributes requested by CFS. Each application has a specific set of attributes, or claims, that it requires CFS to send. So when a user requests access to an application, CFS needs to send values from FID to populate the claim expected by that application. CFS packages those attributes into signed tokens, which it sends to applications in the format they expect. In this way, CFS uses FID as an authentication system and attribute server for all identities stored across the enterprise identity sources, essentially turning your infrastructure into a secure Identity Provider.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1100px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"overview figure 2\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/031fbd5858c0228968383d719eb569f2/28a3f/overview-figure-2.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/031fbd5858c0228968383d719eb569f2/88b8e/overview-figure-2.png 275w,\n/static/031fbd5858c0228968383d719eb569f2/8c3ad/overview-figure-2.png 550w,\n/static/031fbd5858c0228968383d719eb569f2/28a3f/overview-figure-2.png 1100w,\n/static/031fbd5858c0228968383d719eb569f2/8bee4/overview-figure-2.png 1130w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>The RadiantOne FID acts a federated identity hub, integrating all enterprise identity stores, and disambiguating duplicate user accounts that occur across them.
