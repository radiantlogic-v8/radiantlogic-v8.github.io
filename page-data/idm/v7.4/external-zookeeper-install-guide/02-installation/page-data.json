Although RadiantOne comes bundled with ZooKeeper to simplify installation in Dev/QA environments, it is discouraged to use this architecture in production. Shutting down a redundant RadiantOne node (e.g. for upgrading) also shuts down ZooKeeper on this server. Because a ZooKeeper ensemble must have a quorum of more than half its servers running at any given time, this can be a problem for cluster integrity and stability. The solution is to deploy ZooKeeper in a separate, external ensemble. Other advantages of deploying an external ZooKeeper ensemble are outlined in the RadiantOne External ZooKeeper Install guide.</p>\n<p>For details on installing RadiantOne in a Dev/QA environment, where ZooKeeper is installed and configured on the RadiantOne node, follow the steps outlined in this installation guide.</p>\n<p>For details on installing RadiantOne in a production environment, start with the steps in the <a href=\"/external-zookeeper-install-guide/01-introduction\">RadiantOne External Zookeeper Installation Guide</a> to setup the external ZooKeeper ensemble. Then, refer to the steps in this guide to install RadiantOne.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installer-files\">Installer Files</h2>\n<p>The installer files are available on the Radiant Logic support site. Contact <a href=\"mailto:support@radiantlogic.com\">support@radiantlogic.com</a> for access information.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne can be installed via a web-based GUI wizard, or through a silent (non-GUI) installer. The installer files are described below in the table below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nRadiantOne generates a random master key by default to use for encrypting information in configuration files. If you prefer to use Password-based encryption (PBE) to generate the key, you must use a silent install and indicate vds.security.pbe.enabled=true in the <UnzipLocation>/ vds\\install\\install.properties file before using <a href=\"#silent-mode-installs\">Instance Manager</a> to install RadiantOne.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Installer File</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">radiantone_&lt;version>_full_linux_64.tar.gz</code></td>\n<td>This is used for a <a href=\"#silent-mode-installs\">silent install</a> or <a href=\"#gui-based-install\">GUI-based install</a> for Linux platforms that includes RadiantOne documentation.

The value in the radiantone_<version>_full_windows_64.zip.sha512 file should match the output of the certutil command. This helps ensure the installation file is not corrupt.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne must be installed by an administrator user. Even after installing, a standard user without the proper permissions cannot run the RadiantOne Windows service. This behavior is noticed on the following platforms Windows 2012 and Windows 2012 R2.</p>\n<p>If a standard user must be able to manage/use the RadiantOne components, then the user must be assigned Full Control.</p>\n<p>To launch the RadiantOne GUI installer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unzip <code class=\"language-text\">radiantone_&lt;version>_full_windows_64.zip</code> to the location where you want to install RadiantOne.</li>\n<li>Launch a command prompt as a Windows administrator.</li>\n<li>In the command line interface, navigate to the location you extract in step 1.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the bin folder (e.g. c:\\radiantone\\vds\\bin).</li>\n<li>Run Setup.bat.

Follow the steps in <a href=\"#installing-a-single-node\">Installing a Single Node</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"installing-a-single-node\">Installing a Single Node</h3>\n<p>The basic installation involves setting up one RadiantOne node and is sufficient for most development/test/proof of concept environments. It is recommended you start with the basic installation as described in this section and then configure this server to meet the needs of the expected clients/applications. After testing and confirming this configuration meets expectations, you can configure the architecture required for high availability and desired throughput. This may involve deploying another RadiantOne node at a failover/disaster recovery site (which would involve going through the exact steps described in this section on a machine at the failover/disaster recovery site), or deploying RadiantOne in a cluster to achieve throughput needs and/or high availability requirements at a single site/data center. For possible deployment architectures, please see the RadiantOne Deployment and Tuning Guide. Deploying RadiantOne in a cluster is described in the <a href=\"#adding-nodes\">Adding Nodes</a> section of this document.</p>\n<p>Several aspects of RadiantOne are configured during installation. The basic installation steps are described below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nEven if you only deploy one RadiantOne node, the basic cluster configuration is defined during the install. Take note of the cluster settings defined here as they can be used later to add nodes to the cluster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>At the System Check step, verify that the system passed all checks and click Next.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nHardware sizing is a critical component of directory service planning and deployment. The system check report verifies that important RadiantOne system requirements are met. If a test fails, an X is shown, like in the screenshot below. The failure should be addressed before continuing with the installation. Refer to the RadiantOne Hardware Sizing Guide for more information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 375px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 87.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/42d2020f8c0db60397a4b23ab2d96764/8a6f5/Image2.1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/42d2020f8c0db60397a4b23ab2d96764/c1cfe/Image2.1.jpg 275w,\n/static/42d2020f8c0db60397a4b23ab2d96764/8a6f5/Image2.1.jpg 375w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>At the Select a type of installation step, select the Create A New Cluster option.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nShard subclusters are for very advanced use cases involving the storage of millions of identities.

With a proxy virtualization approach, a single root naming context in the RadiantOne namespace can only connect to one backend directory (mounted at the root), and you can’t have the same root naming context represent two different virtual views. Therefore, you can install a new RadiantOne instance cluster (listening on different ports of course) for this. There are also some use cases where you must enforce different RadiantOne global properties (e.g. require mutual authentication) per client application in which multiple instance clusters can be used as well. The additional RadiantOne instances are configured as separate clusters following the steps below.</p>\n<p>To install an instance cluster, on the Installation Type stage, select the Create a subcluster instance option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Media/Image2.16.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing \"></p>\n<p>Instance clusters are managed independently and do not share configuration with the main cluster.
