The cached base DN should be prefixed with action=deltarefreshpcache.</p>\n<p>This indicates that a new image should be created based on the current state of the backend(s) and that this image should be compared to the current cache to determine differences. Cached entries that have changed are updated accordingly.</p>\n<p>With this approach, there is no down time of the persistent cache branch like there would be if you re-initialized the entire cache image. In addition, if you have replicas of your persistent cache deployed in other sites/data centers, they do not need to be re-initialized either. The changes applicable to the forced re-sync are applied to replicas through inter-cluster replication.</p>\n<p>From an LDAP client, connect to RadiantOne as any member of the cn=directory administrators group (cn=directory manager) and issue a search with a base DN of: action=deltarefreshpcache,<code class=\"language-text\">&lt;root_naming_context_of_persistent_cache></code></p>\n<p>Below is an example using the ldapsearch command line client for a persistent cache located at o=cache.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ldapsearch -h vdsserver -p2389 -D\"cn=directory manager\" -b \"action=deltarefreshpcache,o=cache\" (objectclass=*)</code></p>\n<p>You can also use the RadiantOne command line utility (vdsconfig) to issue the search. Below is an example. For more information on the command line utility, see the RadiantOne Command Line Configuration Guide.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">C:\\radiantone\\vds\\bin>vdsconfig.bat search-vds -dn \"action=deltarefreshpcache,</code><pcache naming><code class=\"language-text\">\" -filter \"(objectclass=*)\" -leader</code></p>\n<p>This search triggers a re-sync of the persistent cache image based on the current image of\nentries from the backends.
