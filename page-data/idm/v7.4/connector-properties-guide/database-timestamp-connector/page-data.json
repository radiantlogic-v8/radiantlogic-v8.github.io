For example, if there are two or more processes that update the source table at the same time, and they take about 2 minutes each to run, the processing delay can be set at anywhere between 4-6 minutes. This delays the processing and makes sure the connector captures all changes coming from both processes.</p>\n<p>The property value is in seconds, and the default value is <code class=\"language-text\">0</code>. If the value is set to <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;=0</code>, it means that the property is ignored by the connector. If the value is set to be more than <code class=\"language-text\">0</code>, then only the entries between <code class=\"language-text\">last_cursor</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">current_time – processing_delay</code> are processed by the connector. If an invalid, non-numeric value is set for this property, the connector stops.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sql-filter\">SQL Filter</h3>\n<p>SQL filter is used as part of the request for entries captured by the timestamp connector. Only changes that match the filter are published by the connector.</p>\n<p>A SQL filter is either a single expression or several single expressions joined by binary operators and brackets ( ). Possible binary operators are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">AND</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">OR</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">NOT</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some examples of valid SQL Filters are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ID='5'</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ID='5' AND NAME='ALLEN'</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ID='5' AND NAME='ALLEN' OR CITY='SAN FRANCISCO'</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ID='5' AND (NAME='ALLEN' OR CITY='SAN FRANCISCO')</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">NAME LIKE 'AL%'</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">NAME LIKE 'ALLE_'</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the SQL Filter syntax entered into the property is not correct, an error occurs. The connector waits for the length of time specified in the <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#retry-interval-on-error\">Retry Interval on Error</a> and then tries to get the changed entries in the database again. After the maximum number of retries (indicated in the <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#max-retries-on-error\">Max Retries on Error</a> property) is exhausted, if the SQL syntax is still invalid, the connector stops. You must either remove or correct the SQL filter before restarting the connector. It is recommended that you set the connector <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#log-level\">Log Level</a> to <code class=\"language-text\">DEBUG</code> and check the connector log for the SQL query (<strong>Executing query:</strong>) that is generated to ensure the value entered in the SQL Filter property is translated properly. The capture connector log is located at <code class=\"language-text\">{RLI_HOME}\\logs\\sync_agents\\{PIPELINE_ID}\\connector.log</code> on the RadiantOne node where the sync agent is running. Run <code class=\"language-text\">{RLI_HOME}/bin/monitoring.bat</code> (<code class=\"language-text\">.sh</code> on Linux) <code class=\"language-text\">-d pipeline</code> to locate your sync process and the value of the <code class=\"language-text\">captureHostname</code> propertyId value indicates the machine where the connector.log is located.</p>\n<p>If the connector should process all changed entries, do not enter a SQL filter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"force-sequential-counters\">Force Sequential Counters</h3>\n<p>This property accepts a value of<code class=\"language-text\">true</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">false</code> and dictates how the connector treats entries it picks up from the LOG table that have non-sequential change IDs. The default is <code class=\"language-text\">true</code> meaning that if the connector detects a non-sequential change ID for an entry in the LOG table, it behaves as if there is an error (non-connection error) and the retry logic based on the Max Retries on Error and Retry Interval on Error properties takes effect. Sometimes rows in the log table are not written in the order of the change ID, and if the connector does not wait for the entries to have sequential IDs, some changes could be missed. The connector waits for the length of time specified in the <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#retry-interval-on-error\">Retry Interval on Error</a> and then tries to get the changed entries in the database again. After the maximum number of retries (indicated in the <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#max-retries-on-error\">Max Retries on Error</a> property) is exhausted, if it still detects non-sequential change IDs, the connector stops. You can <a href=\"overview.md#manually-update-connector-cursor\">manually edit the cursor value</a> before restarting the connector to avoid the non-sequential number. Or you can disable the Force Sequential Counters property for the connector.</p>\n<p>If the connector should ignore non-sequential change IDs, and process all changes immediately, set the property to <code class=\"language-text\">false</code>.</p>\n<p>To learn more about connectors, please read the document that describes properties specific to the <a href=\"database-counter-connector.md\">Database Counter connector</a>.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"database-timestamp-connector"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Database timestamp connector"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"For Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, DB2, and Salesforce backends (using the RadiantOne JDBC driver), a timestamp-based change detection mechanism is available.
