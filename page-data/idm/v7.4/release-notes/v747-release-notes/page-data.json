Updated jQuery to version 3.7.0. Updated Angular to version 1.8.3 to address security vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS44396]: Added a query timeout property for the database timestamp capture connector for persistent cache refresh to avoid the connector waiting indefinitely when the database server isn’t responding quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS44649]: Added an audit log to track configuration changes made to RadiantOne. This log is located in RLI_HOME/vds_server/logs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS44882]: Updated GSON libraries and other related Google library dependencies to their latest compatible versions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS44902]: Added support for RadiantOne administrators to disable the ability to set log level to OFF for RadiantOne logs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS44903]: Added checks for logging failures, in which case an email alert gets sent in the event of logging failure. The feature is enabled out of the box but needs to be configured to be able to send emails. In the event of a logging failure, this feature will make an attempt to alert the user, but will gracefully fail and will not interfere with the application's state if the attempt fails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS44916]: Improved the display of TLS/SSL protocols to show the ones that are actually enabled in RadiantOne rather than simply the JDK's default enabled protocols list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS44982]: Added a last logon time in the upper right corner of the Main Control Panel for the currently logged in user.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45064]: Improved the SCIM2 custom data source connection test to better verify validity of credentials.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45093, 45423, 45463]: Added the ability to generate an Entry Statistics Report from Main Control Panel > Settings > Configuration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45148]: Upgraded jars to Apache CXF 3.4.10 to address: CVE-2022-46364 and CVS-2022-46363.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45154]: Updated the slf4j-api-1.7.21.jar to 1.7.26 to address: CVE-2018-8088.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45157]: Removed reporting-web.war from the build dependencies and added it as a file to be deleted during migrations to address: CVE-2017-9096.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45160]: Updated the fastxml jackson dependencies to address: CVE-2022-42004 and CVE-2020-36518.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45163]: Upgraded opensaml v2.5.3 jar to v2.6.5 to address: CVE-2017-16853 and CVE-2013-6440.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45164]: Updated Apache PDFBox and FontBox library versions to 2.0.28 to address: CVE-2021-2790.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45198]: Added a new property in vds_server.conf (useInterceptionErrorCodeOnViews) that controls how error codes are returned from interception scripts in virtual views. This allows virtual views to return a return code other than 1 if that is the desired behavior. By default, virtual views always return error code 1 no matter what is set in the interception script.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45254]: Improvement to display the upload complete message only after an upload has been run.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45261]: Added a checkbox to enable/disable Integrity Assurance for logging. Enabling the checkbox will change the archive format to: zip_sig</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45283]: Improvement so that the MOTD (Message of the Day) popup isn’t bypassed when using PKI Authentication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45285]: Improvement to support defining complex ACIs with the target URL syntax: (target=\"ldap:///<code class=\"language-text\">&lt;targeted DN>?&lt;list of attributes></code>\") For example, the following would allow access to a group by only the group’s owner, (targetattr=\"*\")(target=\"ldap:///o=My Company?manager,owner,role\")(targetscope = \"subtree\")(version 3.0;acl \"Group owner access only\";allow (all)(userdn = \"ldap:///self\");)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45307, 45317]: Added support for a configurable banner to display on all RadiantOne web applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45327]: Added support for a new property (srvRecordLimit) to control the number of servers read from AD Domain SRV records. This is configurable from Main Control Panel > Settings > Server Backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45337]: Added a test authentication button in Main Control Panel > Directory Browser > search result window to allow for testing authentication for a user returned in a search.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45356]: Improvement to the Main Control > Settings > Server Backend > Custom Data Source > drop-down list to remove the test/beta options AWS and Azure to avoid confusion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45359]: Improvement to make Global Sync pipeline transformation mode available during uploads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45383]: Updated the library org.yaml:snakeyaml:1.30 to org.yaml:snakeyaml:2.0 to address CVE-2017-9096.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45431]: Updated JDK version to jdk8u382-b05.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS45452]: Improved the OIDC provider configuration settings for logging into Main Control Panel to allow it to be enabled/disabled as needed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"supported-platforms\">Supported Platforms</h2>\n<p>RadiantOne is supported on the following 64-bit platforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, 2022</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Windows Server Core</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux v5+</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fedora v24+</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CentOS v7+</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SUSE Linux Enterprise v11+</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ubuntu 16+</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Oracle Enterprise Linux 7/8/9</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For specific hardware requirements of each, please see the RadiantOne System Requirements located in the Radiant Logic online knowledge base at: <a href=\"https://support.radiantlogic.com\">https://support.radiantlogic.com</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"bug-fixes\">Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[VSTS44915]: Fix to address a problem of LDAP schema extraction when the directory manager password contains semicolons.
