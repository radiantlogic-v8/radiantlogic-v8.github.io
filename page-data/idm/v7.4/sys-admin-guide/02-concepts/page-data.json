Therefore, be aware that when you import one of these data sources on the target RadiantOne server, the data sources with the same name are overwritten. For this reason, it is recommended that you do not export these data sources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"union\">Union</h2>\n<p>Union is a well-known term in the RDBMS-world and the value of the union operation is key for any federated identity service. Union is essentially the ability to create a list where every user is listed once and only once, even if they appear multiple times in the data stores across the enterprise. User overlap can occur for several different reasons. There could be one user listed numerous times, or multiple users with the same name spread across disparate data silos. The result of a union is a unique list of users that is indexed for each system which enables fast and easy lookups. The reason this capability is critical for an identity service is because it makes the identification of a user more accurate and efficient.</p>\n<p>For example, if you don’t have a single source of users, an application would have to look in all the different data stores across the enterprise to find a particular user. Even if a user is listed in only one store (unless that exact store is already known), an application still needs to locate them, resulting in multiple queries issued (at least one to each source the user could potentially be located in). However, if you have a master index (an “identity hub”), the client application only needs to query this list to locate a user, which results in queries to only the backend stores where the user is located. The more sources involved, the more valuable this global index is. It is this global list that is created and maintained by RadiantOne.</p>\n<p>In cases where the data stores contain user overlap, RadiantOne performs aggregation and correlation, creating a common key to identify users across disparate systems. However, the union operation is still important for data sources that may or may not have identity intersection. If they do not have identity overlap there is no need for correlation, but the function of union is still crucial for building your identity service.</p>\n<p>The diagrams below provide a summary/review of data sources containing duplicate/intersecting identities.</p>\n<p>In the first scenario, the data sources have no overlap of identities. In this scenario the benefits of union would still be important for identity management since a single unique index/list is still required for applications to identify a user for authentication. However, the design effort is a bit easier as no correlation logic is required. An aggregation of sources A, B, and C is sufficient, so the primary design consideration in this case is what hierarchy applications are expecting and to build this namespace accordingly.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 350px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 35.27272727272727%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"data sources with no overlapping identities\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/f9808e7cfa4a19be2628595779e8576e/aaaf9/Image2.3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f9808e7cfa4a19be2628595779e8576e/c1cfe/Image2.3.jpg 275w,\n/static/f9808e7cfa4a19be2628595779e8576e/aaaf9/Image2.3.jpg 350w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 3: Data Sources with no Overlapping Identities</p>\n<p>In cases where there starts to be user overlap (as seen in Sources A and B in the diagram below), the configuration starts to require correlation.

If there is not a single identifier that is common for the overlapping users, then correlation logic is required to determine the match. Correlation links the common users and is required to build a unique list.</p>\n<p>To correlate identities, a logical rule must exist for each data source so that a combination of attributes (eventually transformed) will yield a match for common users. For each source, different attributes can be used to generate the correlation logic.</p>\n<p>To build a virtual view that correlates identities, use the Global Identity Builder. See the <a href=\"/global-identity-builder-guide/introduction\">RadiantOne Global Identity Builder Guide</a> for details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"joins\">Joins</h2>\n<p>Joining is a way to combine information from multiple data sources into a single entry. There are two types of joins in RadiantOne. One type is known as a <a href=\"#regular-join\">regular join</a> and the other is an <a href=\"#extended-join\">extended join</a>. Each is described below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"regular-join\">Regular Join</h3>\n<p>A Regular Join is defined as adding existing attribute(s) from another data source(s) to a virtual entry. The starting point for the join is known as the primary (or main) object. The data sources to be joined are known as secondary (or target) objects. Any object in the RadiantOne namespace can be a primary or secondary object. In RadiantOne, entries representing the same user across all data sources must have a unique identifier (common key) or a set of common identifiers in order to join.

Once a virtual view is in persistent cache, these characteristics are irrelevant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"attribute-priority\">Attribute Priority</h4>\n<p>The priority level is only needed when the attribute name returned from the secondary source is the same (or has been mapped to the same) as in the primary source. The default behavior of RadiantOne is to return a multi-valued attribute if a secondary object returns an attribute with the same name as the primary object (as long as the values are different). If you do not want the attribute to return as a multi-value, you can set a priority for the attributes. The default priority level set for all attributes is normal. From the interface, you would use the priority levels shown below. The corresponding numeric values are also shown and would only be used if you edit the condition manually.</p>\n<p>Priority Level – Numeric Value:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lowest – 1</li>\n<li>Low – 64</li>\n<li>Normal – 128</li>\n<li>High – 192</li>\n<li>Highest – 255</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have defined your virtual view from the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab, select the primary object in the list of Root Naming Contexts. On the right side, select the Objects tab (for database backends, this tab is named Object). In the Virtual Object section, the entire list of attributes coming from the primary object is displayed, returned from any secondary objects, and any computed attributes. Select the attribute name that has more than one source and then click Edit Attribute. The details for the attribute are shown. The origin of the attribute shows all sources the attribute comes from. Click in the Priority column to set the priority accordingly. The attribute with the higher priority is returned in the virtual entry.</p>\n<p>In addition to setting priority, you can also specify whether the attributes returned from secondary sources are hidden (not visible in the virtual entry), searchable, or updateable.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 346px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 49.45454545454545%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Attribute properties\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/e41ad75f1d5a4c62288768785388058b/1b082/Image2.10.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e41ad75f1d5a4c62288768785388058b/c1cfe/Image2.10.jpg 275w,\n/static/e41ad75f1d5a4c62288768785388058b/1b082/Image2.10.jpg 346w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 10: Attribute Properties (Hidden, Searchable, Updateable, Priority/Weight)</p>\n<h4 id=\"hidden\">Hidden</h4>\n<p>You can define an attribute as hidden because you need it for the join (it may be the attribute you are basing your join on), but you don’t want the value to be in the final joined virtual entry.</p>\n<p>To define an attribute as hidden, from the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab, select the view/object below the list of Root Naming Contexts. On the right side, select the Objects tab (for database backends, the Object tab) and in the Virtual Object attribute list, select the attribute you want to hide. Click <strong>Edit Attribute</strong> and check the Hidden in Result box. These attributes are not returned in the virtual entry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf you edit the join condition manually, and want to make an attribute returned from a secondary object hidden, add a value of 256 to the priority weight you have set. For example, if mail were an attribute returned from a join and you had it set with a priority value of 128 (NORMAL) and NON searchable, and NON updateable, then to make it hidden in the virtual entry, you would change the numeric value to be 1920 (128 + 512 + 1024 +256). Mail:1920 is how it would appear in the join condition if you were to edit the join manually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"searchable\">Searchable</h4>\n<p>You can define attributes as searchable or not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If an attribute from a secondary source is defined as searchable, and a client uses the attribute in a search filter, RadiantOne must attempt the join on all entries from the primary source and then apply the filter to see which ones match the client search filter. If attributes from secondary sources must be searchable, RadiantOne must go through every entry in the primary source and attempt to join it with a secondary object. After, the client search filter is applied to the result.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If an attribute from a secondary source is defined as non-searchable, RadiantOne can apply the search filter on the primary entries (to narrow down the possible join candidates) and then only join those entries. The performance is better in this case because the join only needs to occur on a subset of the primary entries.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To define an attribute as searchable, from the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab, select the view/object below the list of Root Naming Contexts. On the right side, choose the Objects tab (for database backends, choose the Object tab) and in the Virtual Object attribute list, select the attribute you want to be searchable. Click on Edit Attribute and check the Searchable box. If you do not want the attribute searchable, uncheck this option. When finished, click OK. Click Save in the top right corner and click OK to apply the changes to the server.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf you edit the join condition manually, and want to make an attribute returned from a secondary object non-searchable, add a value of 512 to the priority weight you have set. For example, if mail were an attribute returned from a join and you had it set with a priority value of 128 (NORMAL) and updateable, then to make it non-searchable, you would change the numeric value to be 640 (128 + 512). Mail:640 is how it would appear in the join condition if you were to edit the join manually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"updateable\">Updateable</h4>\n<p>You can define attributes as updateable or not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If an attribute is updateable, clients may modify the value (remember just because they can doesn’t mean <a href=\"access-control\">access controls</a> will allow it).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If an attribute is not updateable, clients cannot modify the value.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To define an attribute as updateable, from the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace tab, select the view/object below the list of Root Naming Contexts.

Phone:1152 is how it would appear in the join condition if you were to edit the join manually. If you didn’t want the phone attribute to be searchable or updateable (and still have NORMAL priority), it would have a numeric value of 1664.

Otherwise, RadiantOne may not get the attribute(s) from the primary backend that are required to perform the join and the join cannot be done. For more information on limiting attributes requested from the LDAP backend, please see the <a href=\"/namespace-configuration-guide/01-introduction\">RadiantOne Namespace Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"pre-filtering-on-the-primary-source\">Pre-filtering on the Primary Source</h4>\n<p>If the filter in the client search involves attribute(s) that come from the primary (main) source only, RadiantOne pre-filters (applying that filter to the primary entries to reduce the number of entries that are required to join). If the filter in the client search involves attributes that can come from secondary (joined) sources and those attributes(s) are marked as searchable, then RadiantOne cannot pre-filter on those attributes and must join everything first and then apply the filter on the joined result. RadiantOne knows if attributes used in the filter could come from secondary sources if the attribute(s) are specifically requested in the join condition, or if *  is used in the join condition to return everything from the joined source.</p>\n<p>If you require the attributes from the secondary sources to be <a href=\"#searchable\">Searchable</a> (used in a filter from a client search), you must specify them as such. If the filter received in the search contains any attributes that are defined as searchable from a secondary source, then RadiantOne does not pre-filter against the primary source for those attributes. The join is first performed (all entries are joined), and then the filter is applied on the result. For example, let’s say you have a backend pointing to a Sun Directory and you want to join with a virtual view of Active Directory. The following join condition could be defined:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">LDAP://[VDS]/dv=activedirectory,o=vds?sAMAccountName,objectclass,cn:1152?one?(employeeID=@[employeeNumber:VARCHAR(255)])</code></p>\n<p>Since cn is requested in the join condition (as searchable, NOT updateable, and NORMAL priority, dictated by the numeric value), RadiantOne knows that it should apply the filter received from the client after first joining the entries. The Sun entries are joined with the Active Directory entries (where employeeNumber=employeeID) and then the filter requested by the client is applied on the result. Obviously, performance is slower if you want attributes from joined sources to be searchable (because of the requirement to first join all entries).</p>\n<p>However, if a filter also contains an attribute that is only defined in the primary source (and not listed in any join condition), RadiantOne applies the filter on the primary entries to reduce the number that needs to be joined. Then, the reduced number of entries are joined and the client filter is applied on the joined result.</p>\n<p>For example, using the join condition defined above, if RadiantOne receives a filter like: (&#x26;(mail=<a href=\"mailto:lcallahan@rli.com\">lcallahan@rli.com</a>)(cn=laura callahan)), it first searches the Sun Java Directory for entries matching mail=<a href=\"mailto:lcallahan@rli.com\">lcallahan@rli.com</a> (because mail is not defined as an attribute to return from Active Directory). Then it joins the entries that were returned with the corresponding entries in Active Directory. Finally, RadiantOne applies the original filter on the joined entries and the ones that match are returned to the client.

For more information on this setting, please see the <a href=\"/namespace-configuration-guide/01-introduction\">RadiantOne Namespace Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>If the Process Joins and Computed Attributes Only when Necessary optimization is enabled, and the filter coming in from the client request only involves attributes from the primary source, and the attributes requested are only from the primary (main) source, RadiantOne does not need to perform the join. If one of the secondary backend sources is down, RadiantOne does not know in this case because the optimization tells it to only join if necessary, and in this example, a join is not necessary. Therefore, RadiantOne does not know if a secondary backend is down or not. In this situation, the entry (with the specific attributes requested) is returned to the client. If the filter in the client request involves attributes that could come from a secondary source (and they are configured as searchable), or if the requested attributes from the client include attributes from secondary sources(s), the optimization is not possible and RadiantOne must join. In this case, the default behavior is to not return the entry at all. If the client issued a base search, they receive LDAP error code 32 along with the error message from the secondary backend that was unavailable. If the client issued a one level or subtree search, they receive error code 9 along with the error message from the secondary backend that failed.</p>\n<p>If you would prefer RadiantOne return partial entries, then you must specifically indicate this in the external join condition. <a href=\"#deactivating-a-join\">Manually edit the join condition</a> and add the following:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">##ALLOW_PARTIAL_ENTRY=yes</code></p>\n<p>If partial entries has been allowed, and the client issued a base search, they receive LDAP error code 0 (no error) along with the partial entry (whatever information RadiantOne was able to retrieve from available sources). Each returned entry contains an additional attribute of vsyspartialentry=true. If the client issued a one level or subtree search, they receive LDAP error code 9 along with the partial entry (whatever information RadiantOne was able to retrieve from available sources) and an error message from the secondary backend that was unavailable. Each returned entry contains an additional attribute of vsyspartialentry=true.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nDO NOT use the ALLOW_PARTIAL_ENTRY=YES property if you plan on caching the joined view as the whole entry must be in the cache and during refresh scenarios you don’t want a partial entry to end up in the cache.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please see the diagram below for more details on the <a href=\"#join-behavior-diagram\">join behavior</a>.\r\n </p>\n<h4 id=\"join-behavior-diagram\">Join Behavior Diagram</h4>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 523px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 118.18181818181819%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAYABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB7kxYKgDMWf/EABoQAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAjEQERL/2gAIAQEAAQUCKNl45Q0yVH//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/AR//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/AR//xAAZEAABBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAERITH/2gAIAQEABj8CcwaGr//EABkQAQEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAETEhUf/aAAgBAQABPyEBOrXrlj7Oagj5LOzGeaPnV//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQu+CB/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAwEBPxAf/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAgEBPxAf/8QAHBABAQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAITFBUYGh/9oACAEBAAE/EBC941wFjicPK4Usfc4hUfPGUaKd5mrXFVQnuZoIo0qZu367/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Join Behavior Diagram\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/e2bd1713c2080b6e46d1d11a6dddb108/1781c/Image2.13.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e2bd1713c2080b6e46d1d11a6dddb108/c1cfe/Image2.13.jpg 275w,\n/static/e2bd1713c2080b6e46d1d11a6dddb108/1781c/Image2.13.jpg 523w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 13: Join Behavior Diagram</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf the joined virtual view is stored in persistent cache, during refresh operations, all backends must be available for the persistent cache to be refreshed.

Examples of functionality you can introduce are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Complex mappings (concatenations, or string manipulations)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Override the incoming query (pre-processing)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Processing/changing a result (post processing)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nInterception scripts are powerful and offer a lot of flexibility. However, this logic is executed inside RadiantOne so caution should be taken to ensure no undesirable effects. It is highly recommended that you engage Radiant Logic Professional Services to write the interception script(s). If you choose to write your own script(s), the Radiant Logic support team might be unable to diagnose problems in a timely manner. This can result in additional consultation fees imposed on the customer related to the time required to assess and certify the script logic. This is beyond the scope of support and falls under Radiant Logic Professional Services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interception scripts can be configured at a <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#global-interception\">global level</a> (to apply to all root naming contexts configured for the RadiantOne namespace), or for a specific backend (LDAP, Database, Web Services). For details on how to enable interception scripts for your specific type of backend, please see the <a href=\"/namespace-configuration-guide/01-introduction\">RadiantOne Namespace Configuration Guide</a>. This section describes the tasks that are common for interception scripts no matter where they are enabled.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>After the script has been enabled from the Main Control Panel click Save in the upper right corner and apply the changes to the server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit the script located in: <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/custom/src/com/rli/scripts/intercept/&lt;naming_context></code></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br>If you are using a global Interception, the script is: &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/custom/src/com/rli/scripts/intercept/globalIntercept.java</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p>Rebuild the intercept.jar file by clicking <strong>Build Interception Jar</strong> or by using ANT: C:\\radiantone\\vds\\vds_server\\custom>c:\\radiantone\\vds\\ant\\bin\\ant.bat buildjars</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restart the RadiantOne service. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, you must restart the service on all nodes.

If deployed in a cluster, restart it on all nodes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"groups\">Groups</h2>\n<p>Groups in an LDAP directory categorize sets of people who share common roles within an organization. They are primarily used to simplify the configuration of access permissions. Managing access permissions for all individuals on a per-user basis can be time-consuming and inefficient. Grouping users and assigning access permissions to the entire group is a better approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authorization-enforcement-point\">Authorization Enforcement Point</h3>\n<p>When it comes to evaluating access permissions/authorization, the notion of enforcement point should be understood. Based on the specific configuration/use case, the enforcement point is the application itself, and/or RadiantOne.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Enforcement:</strong>\r\n<br>Typically, in situations where the application is configured to assign roles to specific groups, it will be the enforcement point for authorization. This is common with Web Access Management (WAM) products. The application searches the directory for the groups and then checks group membership to see if a particular user should have access to a protected resource. In this scenario, RadiantOne only must respond with groups and members, and the application enforces authorization for the resources it protects.</p>\n<p><strong>RadiantOne Enforcement:</strong>\r\n<br><a href=\"06-security#access-control\">Access control checking</a> can be turned on or off at the level of RadiantOne. If access control checking is enabled, every time a user authenticates to RadiantOne, it verifies whether the user (or a group the user is a member of) has permissions to access the entries. It allows or denies access based on permissions that have been defined.</p>\n<p>Both the application and RadiantOne can play a role in authorization enforcement if required. If access control checking is enabled in RadiantOne, it decides whether the service account the application connects to the directory with can see groups or not. Then, after reading the group entries, the application decides whether a particular user can access a resource based on roles that are defined in the application itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"static--dynamic-ldap-groups\">Static &#x26; Dynamic LDAP Groups</h3>\n<p>Group members can be either static (explicit member DN in the group entry) or dynamic (group members are built based on specific criteria). The benefit of dynamic groups is that they are easier to define and manage because all group members do not need to be manually added/removed one at a time. Only a common filter that encompasses all group members needs to be configured. If a user entry changes (and the change impacts an attribute used in a dynamic group) they are automatically added/removed from groups without requiring a change in the group definition. However, the disadvantage of dynamic groups is that not all LDAP directories support them and even fewer LDAP applications can consume them. This is because the application logic must include the ability to not only request a group but be able to evaluate the memberURL attribute which requires them to issue an additional search to the directory to get the list of members.</p>\n<p>The differences between static and dynamic groups are depicted in the diagrams below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 491px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 49.81818181818182%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"example of static group\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a37fb6e2fe3905442c5891aa72928a97/f6c46/Image2.21.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a37fb6e2fe3905442c5891aa72928a97/c1cfe/Image2.21.jpg 275w,\n/static/a37fb6e2fe3905442c5891aa72928a97/f6c46/Image2.21.jpg 491w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 21: Example of Static Group</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 529px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 48.72727272727273%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAKABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwAF/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHcNhBo7V//xAAYEAACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAxQf/aAAgBAQABBQKEOsP/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAwEBPwGH/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEGH/2gAIAQIBAT8Bh//EABQQAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQEABj8CX//EABkQAQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAITEQEf/aAAgBAQABPyE9C4CayhbNocf/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEJwP/8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIf/aAAgBAwEBPxDELf/EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESH/2gAIAQIBAT8QT0Q//8QAGxABAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARECFBUXH/2gAIAQEAAT8QO/CjcQsa7uIEC/cIHCM//9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Example of Traditional LDAP Dynamic Groups\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/756efa339a1f7e492b8765a266e21032/ba295/Image2.22.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/756efa339a1f7e492b8765a266e21032/c1cfe/Image2.22.jpg 275w,\n/static/756efa339a1f7e492b8765a266e21032/ba295/Image2.22.jpg 529w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 22: Example of Traditional LDAP Dynamic Groups</p>\n<h3 id=\"groups-supported-by-radiantone\">Groups Supported by RadiantOne</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne can be configured for both static and dynamic LDAP groups (as they are described above).

This section focuses on the definition of each type.</p>\n<p><strong>User-Defined Groups</strong>\r\n<br>Static group names are explicitly listed for the group entry (just as with “standard” LDAP group entries). A user-defined group may be named anything and have members that are either statically defined or dynamically created based on a specific rule (dynamically assigned group members are similar to “standard” LDAP dynamic groups). The diagram below depicts an example of user-defined groups with dynamic members. In the example, group members are built dynamically based on the department attribute in the user entries. If a user’s department were to change, they would automatically be reflected as a member of the new group. For simplicity, only the member ID is shown in the virtual entry whereas the full user DN is returned (as an LDAP client expects) when these groups are requested.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 535px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 57.45454545454546%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"User-Defined Groups with Dynamic Members\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/6dc7ba4ede935b1bafc71acfb19cef38/f8ea9/Image2.23.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6dc7ba4ede935b1bafc71acfb19cef38/c1cfe/Image2.23.jpg 275w,\n/static/6dc7ba4ede935b1bafc71acfb19cef38/f8ea9/Image2.23.jpg 535w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 23: User-Defined Groups with Dynamic Members</p>\n<p>Static group members are specific user DNs explicitly listed as members for the group entry. Static group members can be any user DN in the virtual directory tree which means they can come from any backend source.</p>\n<p>Dynamic group members are assigned to groups based on rules defined for specific attributes. The attribute values determine which group the member is associated with. First, determine the starting point in the virtual namespace to locate the possible group members. Then, decide which attribute(s) of these entries should be used to determine which group they belong to. For example, if all user entries that contain a department attribute value of “Sales” or “Sales Associate” should be a member of the Sales group, then the LDAP filter used in the rule would look like: (|(departmentNumber=Sales)(departmentNumber=Sales Associate)). Any valid LDAP filter can be used to create the rule for populating group membership.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto-Generated Groups</strong></p>\n<p>With auto-generated groups, group names are determined based on all possible values of a specified user attribute. The attribute values to determine the group names can be pulled from any virtual entries. First, determine the starting point in the virtual namespace to locate entries that contain the attribute you want to base group names on. Then, decide which attribute of these entries contains the possible group names. For example, if all user entries contained a department attribute, possible group names could be determined by creating a unique list of all possible departments. The list is the basis for creating the group names. If all users were associated with one of five different departments (Marketing, Sales, HR, Support, Engineering), then there would be a total of five auto-generated group names based on these values. The group members are determined dynamically based on the value of their department attribute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThe attribute you select to base the auto-generated group names on must be single-valued in the user entries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The diagram below depicts an example of auto-generated groups with both group names and members generated dynamically. In this example, department names are the basis for determining the group names in RadiantOne. This offers an enormous amount of flexibility. If a new department were to appear in the database, a new group would automatically appear in RadiantOne with this new name. Group members are built dynamically based on the department attribute in their entries. If a user’s department were to change, they would automatically be reflected as a member of the new group in RadiantOne. For simplicity, only the member ID is shown in the virtual entry whereas the full user DN will be returned (as an LDAP client expects).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 414px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.545454545454554%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Auto-Generated Groups with Dynamic Group Names and Dynamic Members\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/59e433b000254332fc5a0cb3ea25b272/175f9/Image2.24.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/59e433b000254332fc5a0cb3ea25b272/c1cfe/Image2.24.jpg 275w,\n/static/59e433b000254332fc5a0cb3ea25b272/175f9/Image2.24.jpg 414w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 24: Auto-Generated Groups with Dynamic Group Names and Dynamic Members</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"05-creating-virtual-views#groups-builder\">Groups Builder wizard</a> for details on creating both user-defined and auto-generated groups.</p>\n<h2 id=\"metadataschema-extraction\">Metadata/Schema Extraction</h2>\n<p>A main key capability of RadiantOne is metadata/schema extraction.
