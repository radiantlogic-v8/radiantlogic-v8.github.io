For steps on replacing the self-signed certificate, see <a href=\"01-introduction#replacing-the-default-self-signed-certificate\">Replacing the Default Self-Signed Certificate</a>.</p>\n<p>By default the SSL port is set to 636 and this is defined during the installation of RadiantOne.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] You must restart the RadiantOne service after changing any SSL-related settings. RadiantOne loads the server certificate when it is started, so in order for the newly added certificate to take effect, restart the server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"forbidding-access-on-the-non-ssl-port\">Forbidding Access on the Non-SSL Port</h3>\n<p>For steps to disable access on the non-ssl ports, please see the <a href=\"/hardening-guide/00-preface\">RadiantOne Hardening Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"supported-cipher-suites\">Supported Cipher Suites</h3>\n<p>To view the cipher strength levels enabled by default in RadiantOne, go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section and click <strong>Change</strong> next to Supported Cipher Suites. The ciphers that are checked are enabled. To change the enabled ciphers, check/uncheck the desired values.</p>\n<p>After changing the cipher levels, save your changes and restart the RadiantOne service.</p>\n<p>For details on installing stronger cipher suites, see the <a href=\"/hardening-guide/00-preface\">RadiantOne Hardening Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enabled-ssl-protocols\">Enabled SSL Protocols</h3>\n<p>The default SSL/TLS protocol options are SSLv2Hello, SSL v3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 and TLS v1.3. Some of the less secure protocols in this list are disabled by default in the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/java.security file, noted in the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property.</p>\n<p>Out of the available protocols, not in the disabled list, you can limit which ones you want RadiantOne to support. You can limit the protocols from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section. Click <strong>Change</strong> next to Enabled SSL Protocols. Select the protocols to support and click <strong>OK</strong>. Restart the RadiantOne service on all nodes.</p>\n<p>If you want to support one of the less secure protocols, edit the java.security file and remove the protocol from the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms value. Then, make sure it is enabled in RadiantOne. Restart RadiantOne on all nodes. If a protocol is enabled in RadiantOne, but in the list of disabled algorithms in the java.security file, it will not be supported at runtime for SSL communication.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Only enable the SSL protocols that comply with your company’s security policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"enable-starttls\">Enable STARTTLS</h3>\n<p>Start TLS allows clients to request a secure channel to RadiantOne at any time without having to establish a new connection on a different port. For example, a client can process an LDAP search operation on a normal connection and then, without closing the connection, request a secure layer over the same connection with StartTLS for the use of changing passwords or viewing encrypted attributes. After finishing the use of the secure channel, the client can switch back to the non-secure channel on the same connection. The flexibility offered by the Start TLS extension allows for the secure LDAPS channel to be turned on and off on demand.</p>\n<p>To enable Start TLS for clients to access RadiantOne:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check the Enable SSL option and then check the Enable Start TLS option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restart the RadiantOne service.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] When using Start TLS, the default server certificate included with the RadiantOne installation does not work. You must generate a new certificate (either self-signed or requested from a Certificate Authority) that contains the proper machine and domain name of the RadiantOne machine. Also, the host name specified from the client should match the value in the certificate. If you try to use the default self-signed certificate included with the RadiantOne installation, the following error message (‘xxxxx’ being your server name) is returned: javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: hostname of the server 'xxxxx' does not match the hostname in the server's certificate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"debug-ssl\">Debug SSL</h3>\n<p>SSL is enabled by default, but SSL logging is disabled by default. When SSL logging is enabled, SSL events have an entry in vds_server.log. This log file is located in &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\vds_server\\logs. SSL events are logged at INFO level, so log settings for VDS – Server must be at least at INFO level.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] For more information on log levels, refer to the <a href=\"/logging-and-troubleshooting-guide/01-overview\">RadiantOne Logging and Troubleshooting Guide</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To enable SSL logging:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the Main Control Panel, click Settings > Logs > Log Settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the Log Settings to Configure drop-down menu, select VDS – Server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verify that the Log Level drop-down menu is set to one of the following: INFO, DEBUG, or TRACE.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you change the log level, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Security -> SSL</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the SSL section, check the Debug SSL box.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Main Control Panel’s Dashboard tab, restart the RadiantOne service.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"certificate-based-authentication-support-for-mutual-authentication\">Certificate-based Authentication: Support for Mutual Authentication</h2>\n<p>A certificate is an electronic document that identifies an entity which can be an individual, a server, a company, or some other entity. The certificate also associates the entity with a public key.</p>\n<p>For normal SSL communications, where the only requirement is that the client trusts the server, no additional configuration is necessary (if both entities trust each other). For mutual authentication, where there is a reciprocal trust relationship between the client and the server, the client must generate a certificate containing his identity and private key in his keystore. The client must also make a version of the certificate containing his identity and public key, which RadiantOne must store in its truststore. In turn, the client needs to trust the server; this is accomplished by importing the server's CA certificate into the client truststore.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Certificate-based authentication (mutual authentication) requires the use of SSL or StartTLS for the communication between the client and RadiantOne.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The diagram below shows how certificates and the SSL protocol are used together for authentication.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 38.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/b966c/Image3.82.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/c1cfe/Image3.82.jpg 275w,\n/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/67061/Image3.82.jpg 550w,\n/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/b966c/Image3.82.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2: Mutual Authentication</p>\n<p>There are three options for mutual authentication and this can be set from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL > Mutual Auth.

This maps the user DN (Subject or Subject Alternate Name from the certificate) to a specific DN in the RadiantOne namespace. After, the DN in the RadiantOne namespace determines authorization (access controls).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] To avoid problems with special characters, RadiantOne normalizes the certificate subject prior to applying the certificate DN mapping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To set the client certificate DN mapping:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > SSL sub-section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Change</strong> next to the Client Certificate DN Mapping property.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] The Client Certificate DN Mapping is only accessible by a member of the <a href=\"01-introduction#delegated-administration-of-radiantone\">Directory Administrator role/group</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are different ways to determine the DN from the subject or subject alternative name in the certificate (using regular expression syntax).</p>\n<p>Setting a specific subject or subject alternative name to DN in the virtual namespace:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">cn=lcallahan,dc=rli,dc=com (the user DN in the certificate) -> (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</code></p>\n<p>Specify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the subject or subject alternative name received in the certificate:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">uid=(.+),dc=rli,dc=com -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a certificate subject of uid=lcallahan,dc=rli,dc=com then it would look for the virtual entry based on:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)</code></p>\n<p>Then, authorization would be based on the user DN that is returned.</p>\n<p>As another option, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the previous example). Let’s take a look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">cn=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=com -> (maps to) ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=$1)(dc=$3))</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a subject from the certificate that looked like: cn=laura_callahan,dc=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com, the search that would be issued would look like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))</code></p>\n<p>RadiantOne uses the DN returned in the search result to base authorization on.</p>\n<p>If the subject in the SSL certificate is blank, you can specify that a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) should be used. You can use an alternative name in the mapping by specifying {alt} before the regular expression. For example: {alt}^(.+)$ uses the first alternative name found. You can be more specific and specify which alternative name in the certificate that you want to match by specifying the type [0-8]. For example: {alt:0}^(.+)$ uses the otherName alternative name.

The CRL has a limited validity period, and updated versions of the CRL are published by the CA when the previous CRL’s validity period expires.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne supports CRL checking and relies on the underlying Java security libraries (JSSE) to handle this logic during the SSL/TLS handshake process before the LDAP bind is received by the server. Both CRLDP and OCSP are supported. For CRLDP (CRL Distribution Point), there are URIs specified by the certificate's \"CRL Distribution Points\", by which the servers hosting CRL can be reached. For OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol), the URIs are specified in the certificate in the extended attribute “authorityInfoAccess”, by which the servers enforcing CRL checking can be reached. More details about OCSP can be found in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2560\">RFC 2560</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-crl\">Enable CRL</h3>\n<p>If clients are connecting to RadiantOne with certificates (establishing mutual authentication) and the client certificate should be validated to ensure it has not been revoked prior to accepting it, the Enable CRL parameter needs checked. From the Main Control Panel go to the Settings tab > Security > SSL. Then, on the right side, check the Enable CRL option.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crl-methods\">CRL Methods</h3>\n<p>There are three different supported CRL checking methods; dynamic, static and failover. These methods are described below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The tradeoff between a static CRL file and a dynamic CRL checking would be that a dynamic CRL would be more robust and correct but the size of the CRL file may impact the performance of the revocation checking logic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Dynamic</strong></p>\n<p>CRLDP and OCSP are used to determine certificate validity and revocation status. OCSP is checked first. If OCSP returns the certificate's status as unknown, then the CRLDP is used.</p>\n<p><strong>Failover</strong></p>\n<p>CRLDP and OCSP are used to determine certificate validity and revocation status (OCSP is checked first). If the checking fails to get the CRL from CRLDP and using OCSP, then it attempts to check the certificate’s status against the static CRL file(s) specified in the <a href=\"#crl-filedirectory\">CRL file/directory parameter</a>. The CRL file(s) are loaded only once when the RadiantOne service starts.</p>\n<p><strong>Static</strong></p>\n<p>The certificate is validated against a preloaded local CRL file (this can be many files zipped together or could be a file system directory where all CRL files are located). The certificate authority’s CRL file must be downloaded and the location of the file must be specified in the <a href=\"#crl-filedirectory\">CRL file/directory parameter</a>. The CRL file(s) are loaded only once when the RadiantOne service starts.</p>\n<p>To select the CRL method, from the Main Control Panel got to the Settings tab > Security > SSL. Then, on the right side, once the Enable CRL option is checked, the CRL Method drop-down list is available. Select the desired method from this list. Click <strong>Save</strong> to apply your changes to the server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crl-filedirectory\">CRL File/Directory</h3>\n<p>If the static (or failover) CRL checking mechanism has been selected, the value of the Server Certificate Revocation List File parameter should point to the CRL file downloaded from the certificate authority. This can be a file containing multiple CRL files if needed. Client certificates can be validated against this list.</p>\n<p>The Server Certificate Revocation List File parameter is configurable from the <a href=\"01-introduction#accessing-the-server-control-panel\">Server Control Panel</a> > Settings tab. If you are deployed in a cluster, each node must have the CRL file on their host machine and the location can vary. Therefore, you must go into the Server Control Panel associated with each node and set the location of the CRL file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inter-nodes-communication\">Inter Nodes Communication</h2>\n<p>Within a cluster, nodes must be able to communicate with each other. This is required for block replication (replicating data across RadiantOne Universal Directory stores) which uses the Admin HTTP Service <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#admin-http-service\">HTTP/HTTPS</a> and redirecting write operations to the leader node which uses <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#ldap-port\">LDAP/LDAPS</a>. If the communication across the cluster nodes should use SSL, choose the Always use SSL option. If your cluster nodes are running in a secured environment (and in general they should be), you can choose to never use SSL. Forcing the use of SSL will slow down the communication speed between nodes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 382px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 33.81818181818182%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Inter Nodes Communication\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/dc918/Image3.86.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/c1cfe/Image3.86.jpg 275w,\n/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/dc918/Image3.86.jpg 382w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 6: Inter Nodes Communication</p>\n<h2 id=\"authentication-methods\">Authentication Methods</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] This section is accessible only in <a href=\"01-introduction#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To access the RadiantOne service via LDAP, the LDAP client must authenticate itself. This process is called a “bind” operation and means, the client must tell the LDAP server who is going to be accessing the data so that the server can decide what the client is allowed to see and do (authorization). After the client successfully authenticates, RadiantOne checks whether the client is allowed to perform subsequent requests. This process is called authorization and is enforced via <a href=\"#access-control-terms--definitions\">access controls</a>.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne supports three types of authentication: anonymous, simple and SASL.</p>\n<p><strong>Anonymous:</strong></p>\n<p>Clients that send an LDAP request without doing a \"bind\" are treated as anonymous. Clients who bind to RadiantOne without a password value are also considered anonymous.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple:</strong></p>\n<p>Simple authentication consists of sending the LDAP server the fully qualified DN of the client (user) and the client's clear-text password. To avoid exposing the password in clear over the network, you can use SSL (an encrypted channel). For details on configuring SSL, please see the <a href=\"#ssl-settings\">SSL Settings</a> section.</p>\n<p><strong>SASL:</strong></p>\n<p>Clients that send an authentication request to RadiantOne using Kerberos (GSS-SPNEGO), NTLM (GSSAPI), MD5 (DIGEST-MD5) or Certificate (EXTERNAL) are leveraging one of the supported SASL mechanisms. The SASL EXTERNAL mechanism is supported by default, but you must configure the <a href=\"#client-certificate-dn-mapping\">Client Certificate to DN Mapping</a> so the RadiantOne service knows how to identify the user in the certificate to a user in the RadiantOne namespace. For details on these supported mechanisms, please see <a href=\"#authentication-methods\">Authentication Methods</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kerberos\">Kerberos</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne supports Kerberos v5, and can act as both a <a href=\"#kerberos\">Kerberos client</a>, and a Kerberized service. As a Kerberos client, RadiantOne can request tickets from a KDC to use to connect to kerberized services. As a Kerberized service, RadiantOne can accept tickets from clients as a form of authentication. These configurations have been certified with Windows 2000, 2003 and 2008 in addition to MIT Kerberos on Linux CENTOS. This section describes RadiantOne support as a Kerberized server. For details on RadiantOne support as a Kerberos client, please see the section on defining <a href=\"04-backend-settings#ldap-data-sources\">LDAP data sources</a>.

For authentication amongst un-trusted/different domains, the NTLM protocol is triggered instead.

RadiantOne uses this information to authenticate to the KDC when it starts if there is no keytab file present. If there is a keytab file present (and RadiantOne is configured to use it), and the keytab file contains the “principal” keyword with a value of the user principal name for the RadiantOne service account in the KDC, it is used to get the secret key/password to use for authenticating to the KDC instead of the settings configured in the Control Panel. If the keytab file does not contain the “principal” defined in it, you must set the user principal name in the Kerberos Authentication section, but you do not need to configure the password.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Copy the keytab file created when running the ktpass utility to the RadiantOne machine (anywhere on the machine is fine) and configure the needed parameters described below. This step is optional. If there is no keytab file present, RadiantOne uses the service principal and password that are defined on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication to authenticate to the KDC.</p>\n<p>If you choose to copy the keytab file to the RadiantOne machine, edit the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/&#x3C;instance_name>/conf/krb5/vds_krb5login.conf file. To enable RadiantOne to participate in SSO with clients via Kerberos tokens, a JAAS login file is needed to tell where and how the RadiantOne service is authenticated. The JAAS login file (vds_ krb5login.conf) is provided with RadiantOne. The default content of this file is as follows:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">vds_server {</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">storeKey=true;</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">};</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne should use the keytab file, add the following parameters to the vds_krb5login.conf file:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">useKeyTab=true</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">keyTab= \"c:/radiantone/amazona-eq3pkp4.LDAP.keytab”</code></p>\n<p><strong>useKeyTab</strong> – set this to true if you want the server to get the principal’s key from the keytab. The default value (if this parameter is not set in the file) is False. As mentioned above, if there is no keytab specified, RadiantOne uses the service name and password defined on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication section on the right side, to authenticate to the KDC when the RadiantOne service first starts.</p>\n<p><strong>principal</strong> – set this to the user principal name of the account in the KDC associated with the RadiantOne service. If this property is not defined in the keytab file, it must be set in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication section.</p>\n<p><strong>keyTab</strong> – set this to the full path and file name of the keytab to get the principal’s secret key. Surround the value with double quotes and the word keyTab is case-sensitive (it should appear in the vds_krb5login.conf file in this exact case).</p>\n<p>For information on other optional configuration parameters, please refer to the Krb5LoginModule class in the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit the RadiantOne Kerberos configuration file to include the realm and KDC. The Kerberos configuration file is named vds_server_krb5.conf and is in &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/conf/krb5.</p>\n<p>Edit this file and set the appropriate values in the [libdefaults] and [realms] sections. Below is an example that matches the use case we have been using in this section.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">[libdefaults]</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">default_realm = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">[realms]</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM = {</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">kdc = 10.11.12.205:88</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">default_domain = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">}</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verify the RadiantOne rootdse responds with the appropriate Supported SASL Mechanisms by using a client (e.g. LDAP Browser) to query RadiantOne with a “blank/empty” base DN. The following should be returned.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">supportedSASLMechanisms: GSSAPI</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">supportedSASLMechanisms: GSS-SPNEGO</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configure Client Principal Name Mapping. This step is optional and can be used to define a mapping between the user who authenticates with a Kerberos ticket and a user DN in the virtual namespace. The DN is required for the RadiantOne service to enforce access permissions (authorization). If no client principal name mappings are configured, RadiantOne creates an account in a local Universal Directory store that is linked to the person who authenticated using a Kerberos ticket.</p>\n<p>There are three different ways to determine the DN from the user ID in the Kerberos ticket received in the LDAP bind (using regular expression syntax). Each is described below.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting a specific User ID to DN. In this example, if lcallahan were received in the authentication request, RadiantOne would base the authorization on the DN: cn=laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">lcallahan (the user ID) 🡪 (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify a DN Suffix, replacing the $1 value with the User ID.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) -> uid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com</code></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) represents the value coming in to RadiantOne from the Kerberos ticket. If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan, then the DN used for authorization is: uid=lcallahan,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com.</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the User ID received in the bind request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan from the Kerberos ticket, it would issue a search like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)</code></p>\n<p>The user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the virtual namespace and to base authorization decisions on.</p>\n<p>For the second and third options described above, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the examples). Let’s look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+)@(.+).(.+).com -> ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=$1)(dc=$3))</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a user ID like <a href=\"mailto:laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com\">laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com</a>, the search that would be issued would look like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))</code></p>\n<p>For more details, please see <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#processing-multiple-mapping-rules\">Processing Multiple Mapping Rules</a>.</p>\n<p>The user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the RadiantOne namespace and to base authorization decisions on. For more information, please see <a href=\"#authorization-of-kerberos-users\">Authorization of Kerberos Users</a>.</p>\n<p>Changing any Kerberos-related parameters requires a restart of the RadiantOne service. Save your changes prior to restarting the service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"accessing-radiantone-as-a-kerberized-service-from-a-kerberos-client\">Accessing RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service from a Kerberos Client</h3>\n<p>The Kerberos client (user or machine) must also have an account on the KDC machine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nRadiantOne must be running on a different machine than the client that is connecting to it, otherwise the Microsoft libraries for LDAP use the local security and not a Kerberos ticket. This is only relevant for LDAP clients that use the Microsoft libraries (LDP and Softerra LDAP Administrator v3.3 for example).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following example configurations describe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Using JXplorer as the LDAP client connecting to RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using LDP as the LDAP client connecting to RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using Softerra LDAP Administrator v3.3 connecting to RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example 1 – Using JXplorer Client</strong></p>\n<p>The Kerberos client user account logs into their machine and they must first make sure that JXplorer is configured to use Kerberos.</p>\n<p>Edit the jxplorer.bat file (to pass a Java parameter specifying where to find the Kerberos configuration file) and then start JXplorer using this bat file.

If no Client Principal Name Mappings are defined or if no mapping results are found for a particular user, RadiantOne translates the user principal name and realm into a DN and stores that user in the local LDAP store below a suffix of ou=krbusers,cn=config. The user DN consists of the principal name and the realm (from which they came from). An example would be:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">uid=lcallahan,cn=NOVATO.RADIANTLOGIC.COM,ou=krbusers,cn=config</code></p>\n<p>In the example above, all users who authenticate from the NOVATO.RADIANTLOGIC.COM realm are located here. Each realm has its own location in the local LDAP store. Below is an example from a different realm:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">uid=sbuchanan,cn=NA.RADIANTLOGIC.COM,ou=krbusers,cn=config</code></p>\n<p>Once the user is stored locally (or linked to an existing DN), they can be added to groups and included in access control lists. This allows users who authenticate using Kerberos access to protected information in the RadiantOne namespace.

You have the option to use NTLM in conjunction with Kerberos, or not at all (based on your company security policy). If used in conjunction with Kerberos, it applies as a backup protocol to be used if there is a problem with Kerberos authentication. If enabled, the NTLM protocol is used if one of the systems involved in authentication cannot use Kerberos authentication, is configured improperly, or if the client application does not provide sufficient information to use Kerberos. If NTLM is not enabled, and there is a problem with the Kerberos authentication, the bind (using GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO) to RadiantOne fails. Also, by using NTLM, RadiantOne is able to support cross-domain authentication. This means, that a user that is not logged into the same domain that RadiantOne is a member of (or a domain that is trusted by the RadiantOne domain) can still access RadiantOne and benefit from NTLM for authentication. RadiantOne supports NTLM v2.</p>\n<p>Like all challenge-response protocols, the password is not sent over the protocol but the challenge instead. Since NTLM relies on the domain controller to authenticate its users, RadiantOne needs to know on which domain controller the challenge is generated before sending the challenge back to the user. This information can typically be retrieved from user’s request. If the domain information is not passed, RadiantOne takes the default one to generate the challenge. The first domain listed in the NT Domain parameter is the default one. The diagram below depicts the architecture and process flows.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62.18181818181818%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"RadiantOne Support for NTLM Authentication\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/eed3901f368917eedc97c805e8e64fa3/b966c/Image3.100.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/eed3901f368917eedc97c805e8e64fa3/c1cfe/Image3.100.jpg 275w,\n/static/eed3901f368917eedc97c805e8e64fa3/67061/Image3.100.jpg 550w,\n/static/eed3901f368917eedc97c805e8e64fa3/b966c/Image3.100.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 18: RadiantOne Support for NTLM Authentication</p>\n<p>In the figure above, since the client is accessing RadiantOne from domain B and VDS has been “kerberized” in domain A (and domain A and B do not trust each other), Kerberos cannot be used for authentication. However, NTLM can. The NTLM authentication flow is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Client binds to RadiantOne - The client sends an LDAP bind request to RadiantOne via GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO along with an NTLM Type 1 Message {e.g. NT_Domain=‘DOMAINB' Workstation='W-RLI06-MACHINE1' }</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne requests an NTLM challenge message. RadiantOne requests an NTLM challenge from the required domain controller. RadiantOne knows which domain controller to send the request to because of the NT_Domain property that came in the bind request. If the NT_Domain property is not passed, RadiantOne uses the first one configured in the NT Domain property list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Domain controller responds with a challenge. The domain controller generates a challenge, and sends it to RadiantOne.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne sends the challenge message to client. The challenge message includes an LDAP bind response code 14 (SASL_BIND_IN_PROGRESS). This indicates the server requires the client to send a new bind request, with the same SASL mechanism, to continue the authentication process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Client sends response message. The client then issues a new bind request via GSS-SPNEGO along with an NTLM Type 3 Message {e.g. Username='test5' NT_Domain=‘DOMAINB' }.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne requests domain controller validate the challenge and response. RadiantOne sends the username, the original challenge, and the response from the client computer to the domain controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Domain controller compares challenge and response to authenticate user. The domain controller obtains the password hash for the user, and then uses this hash to encrypt the original challenge. Next, the domain controller compares the encrypted challenge with the response from the client computer. If they match, the domain controller sends RadiantOne confirmation that the user is authenticated. Otherwise, user is not authenticated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne sends bind response to the client. Assuming valid credentials, RadiantOne grants the client access.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To enable NTLM:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check the NTLM Authentication option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each domain that should be supported needs to be configured in this list. The default domain is empty by default and must be configured.

If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>NT Domain</strong></p>\n<p>A unique domain name that a client may belong to (connecting to RadiantOne from). If the client is not connecting to RadiantOne from the same domain (or a trusted domain), then their domain must be configured otherwise they cannot connect to RadiantOne.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Principal Suffix</strong></p>\n<p>The “Kerberos style” realm that corresponds to the above NT domain.</p>\n<p><strong>DC IP Address</strong></p>\n<p>Enter the IP address of the domain controller you configured in the NT Domain property.</p>\n<p><strong>DC Host BIOS Name</strong></p>\n<p>Enter the host name (NETBIOS name) of the machine hosting the NT Domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Computer Account</strong></p>\n<p>RadiantOne must have a service account (defined as a computer account) in the NT Domain. If the RadiantOne host machine joined an Active Directory (AD) domain, the domain controller should have already generated a Computer account for your host. It is under the node \"CN=Computer, DC=<code class=\"language-text\">&lt;domain></code>\" in AD. However, RadiantOne does not require a physical Computer account to run NTLMv2. It can be a service account but it must be defined under the \"CN=Computers\" container. To create a service/computer account in your NT Domain, from the Active Directory Users and Computers interface, right-click on the \"CN=Computers\" node. Choose 'New' and then click on 'Computer'. Follow the wizard to create a service computer account.</p>\n<p>The Computer Account value you enter in the Main Control Panel must be in format of: <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;computer_name>$@&lt;domain></code>\r\ne.g. <code class=\"language-text\">NTLMv2$@testad.com</code></p>\n<p><strong>Computer Account Password</strong></p>\n<p>The password for the RadiantOne service/computer account in the NT Domain should be entered here. Assigning or resetting the password for a computer account can be done with ADSIEdit. From the Active Directory domain controller machine, launch ADSIEdit (run adsiedit.msc). Browse to the Computer account, right click on it, and choose \"Reset Password\". The password can be entered here. Also update this password for the computer account password property in the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<p><strong>IP Range</strong></p>\n<p>This list defines the IP Addresses for the clients that are authenticated to this configured domain controller. IP Range is required for all configured domains except the default one.</p>\n<p>If the client can send the Domain information to RadiantOne in the Type 1 message, RadiantOne would be able to choose which domain controller to generate the corresponding challenge, which is embedded in the Type 2 message sent back to client. If the client is not able to indicate the Domain in the Type 1 message, RadiantOne references the IP ranges configured and determine the relevant domain. If based on the configured IP ranges (across all configured domains), RadiantOne cannot determine which domain to use, it uses the default one.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Principal Name Mapping</strong></p>\n<p>After authentication via NTLM, authorization (access permissions) must be determined. Client Principal Name Mapping can be used to set up a mapping between the user who authenticates using NTLM and a user DN. The DN is required to set access permissions and for RadiantOne to enforce authorization. If no client principal name mappings are configured (or the ones configured fail to link the username to a valid DN in the virtual tree), then RadiantOne allows <a href=\"access-control#allow-anonymous-access\">anonymous access</a> (you must make sure anonymous access is allowed). To configure the mapping, click <strong>Change</strong> next to the Client Principal Name Mapping parameter.</p>\n<p>There are three different ways to determine the DN from the user ID received in the LDAP bind (using regular expression syntax). Each is described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting a specific User ID to DN. In this example, if lcallahan were received in the authentication request, RadiantOne would base the authorization on the DN: cn=laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">lcallahan (the user ID) -> (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify a DN Suffix, replacing the $1 value with the User ID.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) -> uid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com</code></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) represents the value coming into RadiantOne from the bind operation. If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan, then the DN it bases authorization on is: uid=lcallahan,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com.</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the User ID received in the bind request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan from the bind request, it would issue a search like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)</code></p>\n<p>The user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the RadiantOne namespace and to base authorization decisions on.</p>\n<p>For options 2 and 3 described above, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the examples). Let’s take a look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+)@(.+).(.+).com -> ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=$1)(dc=$3))</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a user ID like <a href=\"mailto:laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com\">laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com</a>, the search that would be issued would look like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))</code></p>\n<p>The user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identity the user entry in the virtual namespace and to base authorization decisions on.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see <a href=\"interception#processing-multiple-mapping-rules\">Processing Multiple Mapping Rules</a>.</p>\n<p>Changing any NTLM-related parameters requires a restart of RadiantOne. Click <strong>Save</strong> prior to restarting. If deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"md5\">MD5</h3>\n<p>If desired, an LDAP client can send RadiantOne a hashed password using Digest MD5 for authentication. RadiantOne must have access to the password in clear. When the password is received, RadiantOne uses the Digest MD5 hashing algorithm to encrypt it and compare to the value received from the client. If the compare succeeds, the bind was successful. Otherwise, the bind fails.</p>\n<p>To enable MD5 authentication, check the MD5 Authentication box from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section.</p>\n<p>Changing any MD5-related settings requires a restart of the RadiantOne service after saving the new settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Server Fully Qualified Name</strong></p>\n<p>Enter the Server fully qualified name for the machine running RadiantOne (&#x3C;machine_name>.&#x3C;domain_name>).</p>\n<p><strong>Client User Name Mapping</strong></p>\n<p>After authentication via MD5, authorization (access permissions) must be determined. Client User Name Mapping can be used to set up a mapping between the user who authenticates using MD5 and a user DN in the virtual namespace. The DN is required to set access permissions and for RadiantOne to enforce authorization. If no client user name mappings are configured (or the ones configured fail to link the user name to a valid DN in the virtual tree), then RadiantOne allows <a href=\"access-control#allow-anonymous-access\">anonymous access</a> (you must make sure anonymous access is allowed).

This is useful for limiting exposure to abuse from request flooding that might result from a misconfigured client or from maliciousness. If enabled, the filter keeps track of the number of requests per second from a connection. If a limit is exceeded, the request is either rejected, delayed, or throttled.</p>\n<p>Requests in excess of the per-second limit are throttled by being queued for delayed processing, and eventually rejected altogether if they continue to accumulate.  An unthrottled request is processed immediately without intervention by the filter.</p>\n<p>To enable DoS filtering:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the Main Control Panel, navigate to Settings > Security > DoS Filter. The DoS Filter page is displayed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make changes to the following settings as required.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Click Enable DoS Filter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Requests per Second per Connection – The maximum number of requests from a connection per second. Requests above this limit will be delayed for processing and eventually dropped if they continue to accumulate. The default value is 25.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minimum Delay in Milliseconds – Over-limit requests will be delayed this long before being processed. Set to -1 to immediately discard over-limit requests, or set to 0 for no delay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Over-limit Requests Pending – After Max Requests per Second per Connection + Throttled Requests total requests within a one-second period is reached, additional messages are ignored and discarded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Processing Time in Milliseconds – The maximum allowable time to process a request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Idle Tracker in Milliseconds – Sets the maximum amount of time to keep track of request rates for a connection before discarding it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Insert Header – Check this option to insert the Dos filter headers into the response.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track Session – Check this option to have usage rates tracked by session (if a session exists).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track Remote Port – Set this option to have usage rates tracked by IP and port if session tracking is not used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IP Whitelist – Enter a comma-separated list of IP addresses that are not to be rate-limited. Each entry is IP address, either in the form of a dotted decimal notation A.B.C.D or in the CIDR notation A.B.C.D/M</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] RadiantOne FID automatically whitelists all hosts that are members of the cluster so that node-to-node communications are unaffected; these hosts do not need to be added to the whitelist. This whitelist displays only the hosts that are added manually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HTTP Response Code – When the DoS filter cancels the processing of a request, it sends back an HTTP response code. Use this setting to change that code. The default value is 430.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Click Save.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"client-certificate-trust-store-cluster-level-trust-store\">Client Certificate Trust Store (Cluster Level Trust Store)</h1>\n<p>Many RadiantOne installed components (e.g. Control Panel) act as client’s to the local RadiantOne service and might require SSL access. Therefore, any time you change the RadiantOne server certificate, you must import the corresponding public key certificate into the Client Certificate Trust Store (unless the signer of the server certificate is already trusted).</p>\n<p>Also, the certificates in the Client Certificate Trust Store are used by RadiantOne to connect via SSL to underlying data sources. Therefore, the appropriate client (public key) certificate (associated with the server certificate of the backend) needs imported into the Client Certificate Trust Store (unless they are signed by a trusted/known Certificate Authority).</p>\n<p>RadiantOne loads all client certificates from the default Java truststore (&#x3C;RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts) when it starts. Then, it dynamically loads all other certificates from the Client Certificate Trust Store. This allows client certificates to be dynamically added at any time without needing to restart the RadiantOne service. When RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, all nodes share the contents of the Client Certificate Trust Store.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nIt is not recommended to import client certificates into the default Java truststore (&#x3C;RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts) since this is overwritten each time there is a RadiantOne patch that requires a Java update and requires a restart of the RadiantOne service every time you add new certificates. For these reasons, it is recommended to use the RadiantOne Client Certificate Trust Store instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Import client certificates into the truststore from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Client Certificate Truststore. Certificates can be viewed, imported, exported or deleted from here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nWhen RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, the public key associated with each server node must be stored in the client certificate truststore if you want the nodes to be able to communicate with each other over SSL.

For more details, see the next section.</p>\n<p>After making changes, click <strong>Save</strong>. RadiantOne must be restarted for the changes to take effect. If deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximum-concurrent-working-threads\">Maximum Concurrent Working Threads</h3>\n<p>This is the number of threads the virtual directory server uses for handling client requests. In other words, this defines the number of concurrent LDAP requests RadiantOne can handle. If there are backends involved (e.g. proxy views without persistent cache), then you must also consider how the backend handles the level of concurrency you define here as well because requests made to RadiantOne may directly result in concurrent requests sent to the backend(s).</p>\n<p>The default value is 16, which means 16 worker threads allocated per processing queue defined in the Number of Processing Queues property. This amount is sufficient for most deployments and generally should not be modified unless recommended by Radiant Logic. You might be able to increase this number if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You are using a multiprocessor system - Multiprocessor systems can support larger thread pools than single processor systems. See the Number of Processors parameter above.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clients connecting to RadiantOne perform many time-consuming operations simultaneously (like complex searches or updates).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne needs to support many simultaneous client connections.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is difficult to provide an exact formula for determining the optimal number of maximum concurrent working threads to set because it depends on the machine and environment where RadiantOne is running. Generally, the value for concurrent working threads should not be modified unless recommended by Radiant Logic. If it is modified, you must verify the value you set with testing. Incrementally change the value and retest. In the test results, you should start to see performance peak and then a decrease. The peak in the curve should represent the optimal setting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"max-pending-connection-requests\">Max Pending Connection Requests</h3>\n<p>The max pending connection property represents a queue of server socket connections associated with requests from clients. This is not managed by the RadiantOne process. As soon as a TCP connection is established to RadiantOne, the connection is removed from the pending queue. A maximum number of pending client requests can be set in the Max Pending Connection Requests parameter. This parameter should not be changed unless advised by a Radiant Logic Support Engineer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"access-regulation\">Access Regulation</h2>\n<p>After a client connects to the RadiantOne service, the amount of activity they perform can be limited by configuring access regulation. The activity checking can be performed based on the user that connects to RadiantOne and/or what computer/client (IP address) they are connecting from.</p>\n<p>The “Restrictions Checking Interval” parameter indicated in the Per User or Per Computer sections is the time frame in which the activity (max binds and max operations) is monitored. Once the time interval is reached, the counts are reset. For example, if Special Users Group checking is enabled, and the checking interval, max bind operations per checking interval and max operations per checking interval are set to 300, 30 and 10 respectively, during a 5 minute (300 secs) period, anyone who is a member of the special users group can bind no more than 30 times to the RadiantOne service and not perform more than 10 operations. This count resets every 5 minutes. If a user attempts to perform more than the allowed number of operations, the RadiantOne service refuses the operation and the client must wait until the checking interval resets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"per-user\">Per User</h3>\n<p>The following groups of users found on the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Limits section > Per User sub-section allow you to configure fine-grained activity control:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nMembers of the Administrators group specified on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Server Front End > Administration section do not have any access limitations in terms of max connections or max operations per second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"anonymous\">Anonymous</h3>\n<p>An anonymous user is a client who connects anonymously (no username or password) to the RadiantOne service. To enable checking for this category of user, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Anonymous section of the Per User Category sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum bind operations that anonymous users are allowed to perform. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authenticated-users\">Authenticated Users</h3>\n<p>An authenticated user encompasses any client who successfully authenticates no matter which group they are a member of. To enable checking for this category of users, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Authenticated Users section of the Per User Category sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum bind operations that authenticated users are allowed to perform. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"special-users-group\">Special Users Group</h3>\n<p>Special Users are anyone who successfully binds and is a member of the special user group defined on the Main Control Panel > Server Front End > Administration section. To enable checking for this category of users, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Special Users Group section in the Per User Category sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum bind operations that users in the Special Users Group are allowed to perform. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"per-computerclient\">Per Computer/Client</h3>\n<p>Computers/client applications are identified by their IP address. IP configurations are located on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Limits Section > Per Computer sub-section. These settings allow you to configure fine-grained activity control per computer/client machines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ip-address\">IP address</h3>\n<p>All client machines fall into this category. To enable checking for this category of computer, check the Enable Access Checking option in the IP Address section of the Per Computer sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum amount of connections all computers are allowed to create. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"special-ip-address\">Special IP Address</h3>\n<p>Any client who connects from one of the IP addresses listed in the Special IP Addresses parameter.</p>\n<p>Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported, and you can indicate a range of IP addresses using “/”. A mix of IPv4 and IPv6 can also be used.</p>\n<p>Example set for a range of IPv4 addresses:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">10.11.12.0/24    which represents the given IPv4 address and its associated routing prefix 10.11.12.0, or equivalently, its subnet mask 255.255.255.0, which has 24 leading 1-bits. This covers the range between 10.11.12.0 to 10.11.12.255.</code></p>\n<p>Example set for a range of IPv6 addresses:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">2001:db8::/32    which covers the range between 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:0 to 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff</code></p>\n<p>To enable checking for this category of computer/client, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Special IP Address section on the Per Computer sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum amount of connections all computers are allowed to create. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf you have enabled activity checking for both users (special users, authenticated and/or anonymous) and computers (IP address and Special IP), the activity per computer takes precedence over the user activity. The order of precedence is special IP addresses, IP addresses, special users, authenticated users, and then anonymous users. For example, let’s say that special user access checking, IP address access checking, and special IP address access checking have been enabled, and the max connections are set to 50, 30, and 40 respectively. Any user who connects that is a member of the special users group from a computer that is not a member of the special IP address group, is only allowed to make a maximum of 30 connections during the checking interval.</p>\n</blockquote>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"ssl-settings"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"SSL Settings"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"SSL settings are applicable to clients connecting to the RadiantOne service via LDAPS and involve enabling SSL/TLS and Start TLS, indicating how mutual authentication should be handled, client certificate DN mapping (for enforcing authorization), managing the certificates in the default Java truststore (cacerts), which cipher suites are supported by RadiantOne, certificate revocation and inter nodes communications (relevant only for cluster deployments).
