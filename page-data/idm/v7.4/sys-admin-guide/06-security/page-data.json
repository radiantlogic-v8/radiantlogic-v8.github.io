For steps on replacing the self-signed certificate, see <a href=\"01-introduction#replacing-the-default-self-signed-certificate\">Replacing the Default Self-Signed Certificate</a>.</p>\n<p>By default the SSL port is set to 636 and this is defined during the installation of RadiantOne.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] You must restart the RadiantOne service after changing any SSL-related settings. RadiantOne loads the server certificate when it is started, so in order for the newly added certificate to take effect, restart the server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"forbidding-access-on-the-non-ssl-port\">Forbidding Access on the Non-SSL Port</h3>\n<p>For steps to disable access on the non-ssl ports, please see the <a href=\"/hardening-guide/00-preface\">RadiantOne Hardening Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"supported-cipher-suites\">Supported Cipher Suites</h3>\n<p>To view the cipher strength levels enabled by default in RadiantOne, go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section and click <strong>Change</strong> next to Supported Cipher Suites. The ciphers that are checked are enabled. To change the enabled ciphers, check/uncheck the desired values.</p>\n<p>After changing the cipher levels, save your changes and restart the RadiantOne service.</p>\n<p>For details on installing stronger cipher suites, see the <a href=\"/hardening-guide/00-preface\">RadiantOne Hardening Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enabled-ssl-protocols\">Enabled SSL Protocols</h3>\n<p>The default SSL/TLS protocol options are SSLv2Hello, SSL v3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 and TLS v1.3. Some of the less secure protocols in this list are disabled by default in the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/java.security file, noted in the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property.</p>\n<p>Out of the available protocols, not in the disabled list, you can limit which ones you want RadiantOne to support. You can limit the protocols from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section. Click <strong>Change</strong> next to Enabled SSL Protocols. Select the protocols to support and click <strong>OK</strong>. Restart the RadiantOne service on all nodes.</p>\n<p>If you want to support one of the less secure protocols, edit the java.security file and remove the protocol from the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms value. Then, make sure it is enabled in RadiantOne. Restart RadiantOne on all nodes. If a protocol is enabled in RadiantOne, but in the list of disabled algorithms in the java.security file, it will not be supported at runtime for SSL communication.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Only enable the SSL protocols that comply with your company’s security policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"enable-starttls\">Enable STARTTLS</h3>\n<p>Start TLS allows clients to request a secure channel to RadiantOne at any time without having to establish a new connection on a different port. For example, a client can process an LDAP search operation on a normal connection and then, without closing the connection, request a secure layer over the same connection with StartTLS for the use of changing passwords or viewing encrypted attributes. After finishing the use of the secure channel, the client can switch back to the non-secure channel on the same connection. The flexibility offered by the Start TLS extension allows for the secure LDAPS channel to be turned on and off on demand.</p>\n<p>To enable Start TLS for clients to access RadiantOne:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check the Enable SSL option and then check the Enable Start TLS option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restart the RadiantOne service.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] When using Start TLS, the default server certificate included with the RadiantOne installation does not work. You must generate a new certificate (either self-signed or requested from a Certificate Authority) that contains the proper machine and domain name of the RadiantOne machine. Also, the host name specified from the client should match the value in the certificate. If you try to use the default self-signed certificate included with the RadiantOne installation, the following error message (‘xxxxx’ being your server name) is returned: javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: hostname of the server 'xxxxx' does not match the hostname in the server's certificate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"debug-ssl\">Debug SSL</h3>\n<p>SSL is enabled by default, but SSL logging is disabled by default. When SSL logging is enabled, SSL events have an entry in vds_server.log. This log file is located in &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\vds_server\\logs. SSL events are logged at INFO level, so log settings for VDS – Server must be at least at INFO level.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] For more information on log levels, refer to the <a href=\"/logging-and-troubleshooting-guide/01-overview\">RadiantOne Logging and Troubleshooting Guide</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To enable SSL logging:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the Main Control Panel, click Settings > Logs > Log Settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the Log Settings to Configure drop-down menu, select VDS – Server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verify that the Log Level drop-down menu is set to one of the following: INFO, DEBUG, or TRACE.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you change the log level, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Security -> SSL</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the SSL section, check the Debug SSL box.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Main Control Panel’s Dashboard tab, restart the RadiantOne service.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"certificate-based-authentication-support-for-mutual-authentication\">Certificate-based Authentication: Support for Mutual Authentication</h2>\n<p>A certificate is an electronic document that identifies an entity which can be an individual, a server, a company, or some other entity. The certificate also associates the entity with a public key.</p>\n<p>For normal SSL communications, where the only requirement is that the client trusts the server, no additional configuration is necessary (if both entities trust each other). For mutual authentication, where there is a reciprocal trust relationship between the client and the server, the client must generate a certificate containing his identity and private key in his keystore. The client must also make a version of the certificate containing his identity and public key, which RadiantOne must store in its truststore. In turn, the client needs to trust the server; this is accomplished by importing the server's CA certificate into the client truststore.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Certificate-based authentication (mutual authentication) requires the use of SSL or StartTLS for the communication between the client and RadiantOne.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The diagram below shows how certificates and the SSL protocol are used together for authentication.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 38.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/b966c/Image3.82.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/c1cfe/Image3.82.jpg 275w,\n/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/67061/Image3.82.jpg 550w,\n/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/b966c/Image3.82.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2: Mutual Authentication</p>\n<p>There are three options for mutual authentication and this can be set from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL > Mutual Auth.

This maps the user DN (Subject or Subject Alternate Name from the certificate) to a specific DN in the RadiantOne namespace. After, the DN in the RadiantOne namespace determines authorization (access controls).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] To avoid problems with special characters, RadiantOne normalizes the certificate subject prior to applying the certificate DN mapping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To set the client certificate DN mapping:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > SSL sub-section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Change</strong> next to the Client Certificate DN Mapping property.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] The Client Certificate DN Mapping is only accessible by a member of the <a href=\"01-introduction#delegated-administration-of-radiantone\">Directory Administrator role/group</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are different ways to determine the DN from the subject or subject alternative name in the certificate (using regular expression syntax).</p>\n<p>Setting a specific subject or subject alternative name to DN in the virtual namespace:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">cn=lcallahan,dc=rli,dc=com (the user DN in the certificate) -> (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</code></p>\n<p>Specify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the subject or subject alternative name received in the certificate:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">uid=(.+),dc=rli,dc=com -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a certificate subject of uid=lcallahan,dc=rli,dc=com then it would look for the virtual entry based on:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)</code></p>\n<p>Then, authorization would be based on the user DN that is returned.</p>\n<p>As another option, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the previous example). Let’s take a look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">cn=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=com -> (maps to) ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=$1)(dc=$3))</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a subject from the certificate that looked like: cn=laura_callahan,dc=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com, the search that would be issued would look like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))</code></p>\n<p>RadiantOne uses the DN returned in the search result to base authorization on.</p>\n<p>If the subject in the SSL certificate is blank, you can specify that a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) should be used. You can use an alternative name in the mapping by specifying {alt} before the regular expression. For example: {alt}^(.+)$ uses the first alternative name found. You can be more specific and specify which alternative name in the certificate that you want to match by specifying the type [0-8]. For example: {alt:0}^(.+)$ uses the otherName alternative name.

The CRL has a limited validity period, and updated versions of the CRL are published by the CA when the previous CRL’s validity period expires.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne supports CRL checking and relies on the underlying Java security libraries (JSSE) to handle this logic during the SSL/TLS handshake process before the LDAP bind is received by the server. Both CRLDP and OCSP are supported. For CRLDP (CRL Distribution Point), there are URIs specified by the certificate's \"CRL Distribution Points\", by which the servers hosting CRL can be reached. For OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol), the URIs are specified in the certificate in the extended attribute “authorityInfoAccess”, by which the servers enforcing CRL checking can be reached. More details about OCSP can be found in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2560\">RFC 2560</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-crl\">Enable CRL</h3>\n<p>If clients are connecting to RadiantOne with certificates (establishing mutual authentication) and the client certificate should be validated to ensure it has not been revoked prior to accepting it, the Enable CRL parameter needs checked. From the Main Control Panel go to the Settings tab > Security > SSL. Then, on the right side, check the Enable CRL option.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crl-methods\">CRL Methods</h3>\n<p>There are three different supported CRL checking methods; dynamic, static and failover. These methods are described below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The tradeoff between a static CRL file and a dynamic CRL checking would be that a dynamic CRL would be more robust and correct but the size of the CRL file may impact the performance of the revocation checking logic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Dynamic</strong></p>\n<p>CRLDP and OCSP are used to determine certificate validity and revocation status. OCSP is checked first. If OCSP returns the certificate's status as unknown, then the CRLDP is used.</p>\n<p><strong>Failover</strong></p>\n<p>CRLDP and OCSP are used to determine certificate validity and revocation status (OCSP is checked first). If the checking fails to get the CRL from CRLDP and using OCSP, then it attempts to check the certificate’s status against the static CRL file(s) specified in the <a href=\"#crl-filedirectory\">CRL file/directory parameter</a>. The CRL file(s) are loaded only once when the RadiantOne service starts.</p>\n<p><strong>Static</strong></p>\n<p>The certificate is validated against a preloaded local CRL file (this can be many files zipped together or could be a file system directory where all CRL files are located). The certificate authority’s CRL file must be downloaded and the location of the file must be specified in the <a href=\"#crl-filedirectory\">CRL file/directory parameter</a>. The CRL file(s) are loaded only once when the RadiantOne service starts.</p>\n<p>To select the CRL method, from the Main Control Panel got to the Settings tab > Security > SSL. Then, on the right side, once the Enable CRL option is checked, the CRL Method drop-down list is available. Select the desired method from this list. Click <strong>Save</strong> to apply your changes to the server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crl-filedirectory\">CRL File/Directory</h3>\n<p>If the static (or failover) CRL checking mechanism has been selected, the value of the Server Certificate Revocation List File parameter should point to the CRL file downloaded from the certificate authority. This can be a file containing multiple CRL files if needed. Client certificates can be validated against this list.</p>\n<p>The Server Certificate Revocation List File parameter is configurable from the <a href=\"01-introduction#accessing-the-server-control-panel\">Server Control Panel</a> > Settings tab. If you are deployed in a cluster, each node must have the CRL file on their host machine and the location can vary. Therefore, you must go into the Server Control Panel associated with each node and set the location of the CRL file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inter-nodes-communication\">Inter Nodes Communication</h2>\n<p>Within a cluster, nodes must be able to communicate with each other. This is required for block replication (replicating data across RadiantOne Universal Directory stores) which uses the Admin HTTP Service <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#admin-http-service\">HTTP/HTTPS</a> and redirecting write operations to the leader node which uses <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#ldap-port\">LDAP/LDAPS</a>. If the communication across the cluster nodes should use SSL, choose the Always use SSL option. If your cluster nodes are running in a secured environment (and in general they should be), you can choose to never use SSL. Forcing the use of SSL will slow down the communication speed between nodes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 382px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 33.81818181818182%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Inter Nodes Communication\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/dc918/Image3.86.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/c1cfe/Image3.86.jpg 275w,\n/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/dc918/Image3.86.jpg 382w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 6: Inter Nodes Communication</p>\n<h2 id=\"client-certificate-trust-store-cluster-level-trust-store\">Client Certificate Trust Store (Cluster Level Trust Store)</h2>\n<p>Many RadiantOne installed components (e.g. Control Panel) act as client’s to the local RadiantOne service and might require SSL access. Therefore, any time you change the RadiantOne server certificate, you must import the corresponding public key certificate into the Client Certificate Trust Store (unless the signer of the server certificate is already trusted).</p>\n<p>Also, the certificates in the Client Certificate Trust Store are used by RadiantOne to connect via SSL to underlying data sources. Therefore, the appropriate client (public key) certificate (associated with the server certificate of the backend) needs imported into the Client Certificate Trust Store (unless they are signed by a trusted/known Certificate Authority).</p>\n<p>RadiantOne loads all client certificates from the default Java truststore (&#x3C;RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts) when it starts. Then, it dynamically loads all other certificates from the Client Certificate Trust Store. This allows client certificates to be dynamically added at any time without needing to restart the RadiantOne service. When RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, all nodes share the contents of the Client Certificate Trust Store.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nIt is not recommended to import client certificates into the default Java truststore (&#x3C;RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts) since this is overwritten each time there is a RadiantOne patch that requires a Java update and requires a restart of the RadiantOne service every time you add new certificates. For these reasons, it is recommended to use the RadiantOne Client Certificate Trust Store instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Import client certificates into the truststore from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Client Certificate Truststore. Certificates can be viewed, imported, exported or deleted from here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nWhen RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, the public key associated with each server node must be stored in the client certificate truststore if you want the nodes to be able to communicate with each other over SSL.

This is useful for limiting exposure to abuse from request flooding that might result from a misconfigured client or from maliciousness. If enabled, the filter keeps track of the number of requests per second from a connection. If a limit is exceeded, the request is either rejected, delayed, or throttled.</p>\n<p>Requests in excess of the per-second limit are throttled by being queued for delayed processing, and eventually rejected altogether if they continue to accumulate.  An unthrottled request is processed immediately without intervention by the filter.</p>\n<p>To enable DoS filtering:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the Main Control Panel, navigate to Settings > Security > DoS Filter. The DoS Filter page is displayed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make changes to the following settings as required.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Click Enable DoS Filter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Requests per Second per Connection – The maximum number of requests from a connection per second. Requests above this limit will be delayed for processing and eventually dropped if they continue to accumulate. The default value is 25.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minimum Delay in Milliseconds – Over-limit requests will be delayed this long before being processed. Set to -1 to immediately discard over-limit requests, or set to 0 for no delay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Over-limit Requests Pending – After Max Requests per Second per Connection + Throttled Requests total requests within a one-second period is reached, additional messages are ignored and discarded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Processing Time in Milliseconds – The maximum allowable time to process a request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Idle Tracker in Milliseconds – Sets the maximum amount of time to keep track of request rates for a connection before discarding it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Insert Header – Check this option to insert the Dos filter headers into the response.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track Session – Check this option to have usage rates tracked by session (if a session exists).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track Remote Port – Set this option to have usage rates tracked by IP and port if session tracking is not used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IP Whitelist – Enter a comma-separated list of IP addresses that are not to be rate-limited.
