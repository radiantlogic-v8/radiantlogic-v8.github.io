This process is called a “bind” operation and means, the client must tell the LDAP server who is going to be accessing the data so that the server can decide what the client is allowed to see and do (authorization). After the client successfully authenticates, RadiantOne checks whether the client is allowed to perform subsequent requests. This process is called authorization and is enforced via <a href=\"#access-control-terms--definitions\">access controls</a>.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne supports three types of authentication: anonymous, simple and SASL.</p>\n<p><strong>Anonymous:</strong></p>\n<p>Clients that send an LDAP request without doing a \"bind\" are treated as anonymous. Clients who bind to RadiantOne without a password value are also considered anonymous.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple:</strong></p>\n<p>Simple authentication consists of sending the LDAP server the fully qualified DN of the client (user) and the client's clear-text password. To avoid exposing the password in clear over the network, you can use SSL (an encrypted channel). For details on configuring SSL, please see the <a href=\"#ssl-settings\">SSL Settings</a> section.</p>\n<p><strong>SASL:</strong></p>\n<p>Clients that send an authentication request to RadiantOne using Kerberos (GSS-SPNEGO), NTLM (GSSAPI), MD5 (DIGEST-MD5) or Certificate (EXTERNAL) are leveraging one of the supported SASL mechanisms. The SASL EXTERNAL mechanism is supported by default, but you must configure the <a href=\"#client-certificate-dn-mapping\">Client Certificate to DN Mapping</a> so the RadiantOne service knows how to identify the user in the certificate to a user in the RadiantOne namespace.

These subjects are described in this section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-ssl\">Enable SSL</h3>\n<p>SSL/TLS is enabled by default (TLS v1.0, v1.1 and v1.2 are supported), and during the installation of RadiantOne a self-signed default certificate is generated.

The certificate also associates the entity with a public key.</p>\n<p>For normal SSL communications, where the only requirement is that the client trusts the server, no additional configuration is necessary (if both entities trust each other). For mutual authentication, where there is a reciprocal trust relationship between the client and the server, the client must generate a certificate containing his identity and private key in his keystore. The client must also make a version of the certificate containing his identity and public key, which RadiantOne must store in its truststore. In turn, the client needs to trust the server; this is accomplished by importing the server's CA certificate into the client truststore.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Certificate-based authentication (mutual authentication) requires the use of SSL or StartTLS for the communication between the client and RadiantOne.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The diagram below shows how certificates and the SSL protocol are used together for authentication.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 38.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/b966c/Image3.82.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/c1cfe/Image3.82.jpg 275w,\n/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/67061/Image3.82.jpg 550w,\n/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/b966c/Image3.82.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2: Mutual Authentication</p>\n<p>There are three options for mutual authentication and this can be set from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL > Mutual Auth.

Let’s take a look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">cn=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=com -> (maps to) ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=$1)(dc=$3))</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a subject from the certificate that looked like: cn=laura_callahan,dc=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com, the search that would be issued would look like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))</code></p>\n<p>RadiantOne uses the DN returned in the search result to base authorization on.</p>\n<p>If the subject in the SSL certificate is blank, you can specify that a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) should be used. You can use an alternative name in the mapping by specifying {alt} before the regular expression. For example: {alt}^(.+)$ uses the first alternative name found. You can be more specific and specify which alternative name in the certificate that you want to match by specifying the type [0-8]. For example: {alt:0}^(.+)$ uses the otherName alternative name.

The ciphers that are checked are enabled. To change the enabled ciphers, check/uncheck the desired values.</p>\n<p>After changing the cipher levels, save your changes and restart the RadiantOne service.</p>\n<p>For details on installing stronger cipher suites, see the <a href=\"/hardening-guide/00-preface\">RadiantOne Hardening Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enabled-ssl-protocols\">Enabled SSL Protocols</h3>\n<p>The default SSL/TLS protocol options are SSLv2Hello, SSL v3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 and TLS v1.3. Some of the less secure protocols in this list are disabled by default in the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/java.security file, noted in the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property.</p>\n<p>Out of the available protocols, not in the disabled list, you can limit which ones you want RadiantOne to support. You can limit the protocols from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section. Click <strong>Change</strong> next to Enabled SSL Protocols. Select the protocols to support and click <strong>OK</strong>. Restart the RadiantOne service on all nodes.</p>\n<p>If you want to support one of the less secure protocols, edit the java.security file and remove the protocol from the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms value. Then, make sure it is enabled in RadiantOne. Restart RadiantOne on all nodes. If a protocol is enabled in RadiantOne, but in the list of disabled algorithms in the java.security file, it will not be supported at runtime for SSL communication.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Only enable the SSL protocols that comply with your company’s security policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"enable-starttls\">Enable STARTTLS</h3>\n<p>Start TLS allows clients to request a secure channel to RadiantOne at any time without having to establish a new connection on a different port. For example, a client can process an LDAP search operation on a normal connection and then, without closing the connection, request a secure layer over the same connection with StartTLS for the use of changing passwords or viewing encrypted attributes. After finishing the use of the secure channel, the client can switch back to the non-secure channel on the same connection. The flexibility offered by the Start TLS extension allows for the secure LDAPS channel to be turned on and off on demand.</p>\n<p>To enable Start TLS for clients to access RadiantOne:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check the Enable SSL option and then check the Enable Start TLS option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restart the RadiantOne service.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] When using Start TLS, the default server certificate included with the RadiantOne installation does not work. You must generate a new certificate (either self-signed or requested from a Certificate Authority) that contains the proper machine and domain name of the RadiantOne machine. Also, the host name specified from the client should match the value in the certificate. If you try to use the default self-signed certificate included with the RadiantOne installation, the following error message (‘xxxxx’ being your server name) is returned: javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: hostname of the server 'xxxxx' does not match the hostname in the server's certificate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"debug-ssl\">Debug SSL</h3>\n<p>SSL is enabled by default, but SSL logging is disabled by default. When SSL logging is enabled, SSL events have an entry in vds_server.log. This log file is located in &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\vds_server\\logs. SSL events are logged at INFO level, so log settings for VDS – Server must be at least at INFO level.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] For more information on log levels, refer to the <a href=\"/logging-and-troubleshooting-guide/01-overview\">RadiantOne Logging and Troubleshooting Guide</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To enable SSL logging:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the Main Control Panel, click Settings > Logs > Log Settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the Log Settings to Configure drop-down menu, select VDS – Server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verify that the Log Level drop-down menu is set to one of the following: INFO, DEBUG, or TRACE.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you change the log level, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Security -> SSL</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the SSL section, check the Debug SSL box.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Main Control Panel’s Dashboard tab, restart the RadiantOne service.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"certificate-revocation-list\">Certificate Revocation List</h3>\n<p>A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list identifying revoked certificates, signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) and made available to the public. The CRL has a limited validity period, and updated versions of the CRL are published by the CA when the previous CRL’s validity period expires.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne supports CRL checking and relies on the underlying Java security libraries (JSSE) to handle this logic during the SSL/TLS handshake process before the LDAP bind is received by the server. Both CRLDP and OCSP are supported. For CRLDP (CRL Distribution Point), there are URIs specified by the certificate's \"CRL Distribution Points\", by which the servers hosting CRL can be reached. For OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol), the URIs are specified in the certificate in the extended attribute “authorityInfoAccess”, by which the servers enforcing CRL checking can be reached. More details about OCSP can be found in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2560\">RFC 2560</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"enable-crl\">Enable CRL</h4>\n<p>If clients are connecting to RadiantOne with certificates (establishing mutual authentication) and the client certificate should be validated to ensure it has not been revoked prior to accepting it, the Enable CRL parameter needs checked. From the Main Control Panel go to the Settings tab > Security > SSL. Then, on the right side, check the Enable CRL option.</p>\n<h4 id=\"crl-methods\">CRL Methods</h4>\n<p>There are three different supported CRL checking methods; dynamic, static and failover. These methods are described below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The tradeoff between a static CRL file and a dynamic CRL checking would be that a dynamic CRL would be more robust and correct but the size of the CRL file may impact the performance of the revocation checking logic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic\">Dynamic</h3>\n<p>CRLDP and OCSP are used to determine certificate validity and revocation status. OCSP is checked first. If OCSP returns the certificate's status as unknown, then the CRLDP is used.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failover\">Failover</h3>\n<p>CRLDP and OCSP are used to determine certificate validity and revocation status (OCSP is checked first). If the checking fails to get the CRL from CRLDP and using OCSP, then it attempts to check the certificate’s status against the static CRL file(s) specified in the <a href=\"#crl-filedirectory\">CRL file/directory parameter</a>. The CRL file(s) are loaded only once when the RadiantOne service starts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"static\">Static</h3>\n<p>The certificate is validated against a preloaded local CRL file (this can be many files zipped together or could be a file system directory where all CRL files are located). The certificate authority’s CRL file must be downloaded and the location of the file must be specified in the <a href=\"#crl-filedirectory\">CRL file/directory parameter</a>. The CRL file(s) are loaded only once when the RadiantOne service starts.</p>\n<p>To select the CRL method, from the Main Control Panel got to the Settings tab > Security > SSL. Then, on the right side, once the Enable CRL option is checked, the CRL Method drop-down list is available. Select the desired method from this list. Click <strong>Save</strong> to apply your changes to the server.</p>\n<h4 id=\"crl-filedirectory\">CRL File/Directory</h4>\n<p>If the static (or failover) CRL checking mechanism has been selected, the value of the Server Certificate Revocation List File parameter should point to the CRL file downloaded from the certificate authority. This can be a file containing multiple CRL files if needed. Client certificates can be validated against this list.</p>\n<p>The Server Certificate Revocation List File parameter is configurable from the <a href=\"01-introduction#accessing-the-server-control-panel\">Server Control Panel</a> > Settings tab. If you are deployed in a cluster, each node must have the CRL file on their host machine and the location can vary. Therefore, you must go into the Server Control Panel associated with each node and set the location of the CRL file.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inter-nodes-communication\">Inter Nodes Communication</h3>\n<p>Within a cluster, nodes must be able to communicate with each other. This is required for block replication (replicating data across RadiantOne Universal Directory stores) which uses the Admin HTTP Service <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#admin-http-service\">HTTP/HTTPS</a> and redirecting write operations to the leader node which uses <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#ldap-port\">LDAP/LDAPS</a>. If the communication across the cluster nodes should use SSL, choose the Always use SSL option. If your cluster nodes are running in a secured environment (and in general they should be), you can choose to never use SSL. Forcing the use of SSL will slow down the communication speed between nodes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 382px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 33.81818181818182%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAHABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIF/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB3QUD/8QAFBABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAQABBQJ//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPwE//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAFBABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAQAGPwJ//8QAFhABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgQAQ/9oACAEBAAE/ISM//9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABBwD//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8QP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8QP//EABsQAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACFBUYGh/9oACAEBAAE/EEialqM5cgAuJ//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Inter Nodes Communication\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/dc918/Image3.86.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/c1cfe/Image3.86.jpg 275w,\n/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/dc918/Image3.86.jpg 382w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 6: Inter Nodes Communication</p>\n<h2 id=\"authentication-methods\">Authentication Methods</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] This section is accessible only in <a href=\"01-introduction#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"kerberos\">Kerberos</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne supports Kerberos v5, and can act as both a <a href=\"#kerberos\">Kerberos client</a>, and a Kerberized service. As a Kerberos client, RadiantOne can request tickets from a KDC to use to connect to kerberized services. As a Kerberized service, RadiantOne can accept tickets from clients as a form of authentication. These configurations have been certified with Windows 2000, 2003 and 2008 in addition to MIT Kerberos on Linux CENTOS. This section describes RadiantOne support as a Kerberized server.

For authentication amongst un-trusted/different domains, the NTLM protocol is triggered instead. For details on configuring cross-domain authentication for RadiantOne, please see the section on <a href=\"#ntlm\">NTLM</a>.

Also, if you have deployed RadiantOne in a cluster, the service account created in the KDC can use the server name of the load balancer that is configured in front of the RadiantOne cluster nodes. <br> To use a generic or common account for multiple RadiantOne cluster nodes, you need to set the SPN on the account matching the FQDN of the host that requests the kerberos ticket. There is no need to create individual accounts for each RadiantOne node/host. Refer to the account using the UPN in the RadiantOne configuration. <br> The account can have multiple SPNs. An example is shown below.<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>sAMAccountName: svc-vdsadmin\r\n<br>UPN: ldap/vds.<a href=\"mailto:example.net@example.net\">example.net@example.net</a>\r\n<br>SPN: ldap/host1.example.net\r\n<br>ldap/vds.example.net\r\n<br>ldap/host2.example.net\r\n<br>ldap/host3.example.net</p>\n<h4 id=\"configuring-radiantone-as-a-kerberized-service\">Configuring RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] RadiantOne MUST be running on port 389. The default port for RadiantOne is 2389. To change the port, you must stop the RadiantOne service, and then edit the port from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Administration section. After changing the port and saving your changes, restart the RadiantOne service. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, all the service on all nodes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create a Kerberos identification for the RadiantOne service by creating a user account in the Active Directory domain controller (KDC) for the host computer on which RadiantOne runs. When creating the account, you can use the name of the computer. For example, if the host is named AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com, create a user in Active Directory with a user logon name of AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] If you have deployed RadiantOne in a cluster behind a load balancer (the clients access the load balancer), the KDC service account in Active Directory should use the server name of the load balancer. The UPN of the account should represent the load balancer machine and the SPN attribute should list the FQDN of each RadiantOne node in the cluster (as separate values of the SPN attribute). There is no need to create individual accounts for each RadiantOne host because the KDC account can have multiple SPNs.

RadiantOne uses this information to authenticate to the KDC when it starts if there is no keytab file present. If there is a keytab file present (and RadiantOne is configured to use it), and the keytab file contains the “principal” keyword with a value of the user principal name for the RadiantOne service account in the KDC, it is used to get the secret key/password to use for authenticating to the KDC instead of the settings configured in the Control Panel. If the keytab file does not contain the “principal” defined in it, you must set the user principal name in the Kerberos Authentication section, but you do not need to configure the password.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Copy the keytab file created when running the ktpass utility to the RadiantOne machine (anywhere on the machine is fine) and configure the needed parameters described below. This step is optional. If there is no keytab file present, RadiantOne uses the service principal and password that are defined on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication to authenticate to the KDC.</p>\n<p>If you choose to copy the keytab file to the RadiantOne machine, edit the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/&#x3C;instance_name>/conf/krb5/vds_krb5login.conf file. To enable RadiantOne to participate in SSO with clients via Kerberos tokens, a JAAS login file is needed to tell where and how the RadiantOne service is authenticated. The JAAS login file (vds_ krb5login.conf) is provided with RadiantOne. The default content of this file is as follows:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">vds_server {</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">storeKey=true;</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">};</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne should use the keytab file, add the following parameters to the vds_krb5login.conf file:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">useKeyTab=true</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">keyTab= \"c:/radiantone/amazona-eq3pkp4.LDAP.keytab”</code></p>\n<p><strong>useKeyTab</strong> – set this to true if you want the server to get the principal’s key from the keytab. The default value (if this parameter is not set in the file) is False. As mentioned above, if there is no keytab specified, RadiantOne uses the service name and password defined on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication section on the right side, to authenticate to the KDC when the RadiantOne service first starts.</p>\n<p><strong>principal</strong> – set this to the user principal name of the account in the KDC associated with the RadiantOne service. If this property is not defined in the keytab file, it must be set in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication section.</p>\n<p><strong>keyTab</strong> – set this to the full path and file name of the keytab to get the principal’s secret key. Surround the value with double quotes and the word keyTab is case-sensitive (it should appear in the vds_krb5login.conf file in this exact case).</p>\n<p>For information on other optional configuration parameters, please refer to the Krb5LoginModule class in the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit the RadiantOne Kerberos configuration file to include the realm and KDC. The Kerberos configuration file is named vds_server_krb5.conf and is in &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/conf/krb5.</p>\n<p>Edit this file and set the appropriate values in the [libdefaults] and [realms] sections. Below is an example that matches the use case we have been using in this section.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">[libdefaults]</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">default_realm = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">[realms]</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM = {</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">kdc = 10.11.12.205:88</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">default_domain = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">}</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verify the RadiantOne rootdse responds with the appropriate Supported SASL Mechanisms by using a client (e.g. LDAP Browser) to query RadiantOne with a “blank/empty” base DN. The following should be returned.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">supportedSASLMechanisms: GSSAPI</code>\r\n<br> <code class=\"language-text\">supportedSASLMechanisms: GSS-SPNEGO</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configure Client Principal Name Mapping. This step is optional and can be used to define a mapping between the user who authenticates with a Kerberos ticket and a user DN in the virtual namespace. The DN is required for the RadiantOne service to enforce access permissions (authorization). If no client principal name mappings are configured, RadiantOne creates an account in a local Universal Directory store that is linked to the person who authenticated using a Kerberos ticket.</p>\n<p>There are three different ways to determine the DN from the user ID in the Kerberos ticket received in the LDAP bind (using regular expression syntax). Each is described below.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting a specific User ID to DN. In this example, if lcallahan were received in the authentication request, RadiantOne would base the authorization on the DN: cn=laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">lcallahan (the user ID) 🡪 (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify a DN Suffix, replacing the $1 value with the User ID.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) -> uid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com</code></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) represents the value coming in to RadiantOne from the Kerberos ticket. If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan, then the DN used for authorization is: uid=lcallahan,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com.</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the User ID received in the bind request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan from the Kerberos ticket, it would issue a search like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)</code></p>\n<p>The user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the virtual namespace and to base authorization decisions on.</p>\n<p>For the second and third options described above, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the examples). Let’s look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+)@(.+).(.+).com -> ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=$1)(dc=$3))</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a user ID like <a href=\"mailto:laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com\">laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com</a>, the search that would be issued would look like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))</code></p>\n<p>For more details, please see <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#processing-multiple-mapping-rules\">Processing Multiple Mapping Rules</a>.</p>\n<p>The user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the RadiantOne namespace and to base authorization decisions on. For more information, please see <a href=\"#authorization-of-kerberos-users\">Authorization of Kerberos Users</a>.</p>\n<p>Changing any Kerberos-related parameters requires a restart of the RadiantOne service. Save your changes prior to restarting the service.</p>\n<h4 id=\"accessing-radiantone-as-a-kerberized-service-from-a-kerberos-client\">Accessing RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service from a Kerberos Client</h4>\n<p>The Kerberos client (user or machine) must also have an account on the KDC machine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nRadiantOne must be running on a different machine than the client that is connecting to it, otherwise the Microsoft libraries for LDAP use the local security and not a Kerberos ticket. This is only relevant for LDAP clients that use the Microsoft libraries (LDP and Softerra LDAP Administrator v3.3 for example).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following example configurations describe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Using JXplorer as the LDAP client connecting to RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using LDP as the LDAP client connecting to RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using Softerra LDAP Administrator v3.3 connecting to RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example 1 – Using JXplorer Client</strong></p>\n<p>The Kerberos client user account logs into their machine and they must first make sure that JXplorer is configured to use Kerberos.</p>\n<p>Edit the jxplorer.bat file (to pass a Java parameter specifying where to find the Kerberos configuration file) and then start JXplorer using this bat file.

If no Client Principal Name Mappings are defined or if no mapping results are found for a particular user, RadiantOne translates the user principal name and realm into a DN and stores that user in the local LDAP store below a suffix of ou=krbusers,cn=config. The user DN consists of the principal name and the realm (from which they came from). An example would be:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">uid=lcallahan,cn=NOVATO.RADIANTLOGIC.COM,ou=krbusers,cn=config</code></p>\n<p>In the example above, all users who authenticate from the NOVATO.RADIANTLOGIC.COM realm are located here. Each realm has its own location in the local LDAP store. Below is an example from a different realm:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">uid=sbuchanan,cn=NA.RADIANTLOGIC.COM,ou=krbusers,cn=config</code></p>\n<p>Once the user is stored locally (or linked to an existing DN), they can be added to groups and included in access control lists. This allows users who authenticate using Kerberos access to protected information in the RadiantOne namespace. See below for the location in the directory tree for the authenticated users (This location is for users that could not be linked using Client Principal Name Mappings).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 245px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 126.53061224489797%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAZABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwX/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHuWrJcGSRoD//EABgQAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEAAx/9oACAEBAAEFAqcI2WN0T//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQMBAT8BH//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQIBAT8BH//EABYQAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQIP/aAAgBAQAGPwLRS//EABoQAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQABExIWH/2gAIAQEAAT8hwwUVseyiOjBWeMbX/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABAwDQD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/EB//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/EB//xAAfEAEAAQMEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAQMSFBUXGhsdH/2gAIAQEAAT8QQdJzLq0QHfiWwSIEWssR9pDAi9tgQ8u07VwAM6RbzX1Wbq3/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/46282b89605bd144f092b32b595ff9ab/bf02a/Image3.99.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/46282b89605bd144f092b32b595ff9ab/bf02a/Image3.99.jpg 245w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 17: Location of Users who Successfully Authenticate using Kerberos</p>\n<h3 id=\"ntlm\">NTLM</h3>\n<p>SASL binding via GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO will attempt to use Kerberos by default. You have the option to use NTLM in conjunction with Kerberos, or not at all (based on your company security policy). If used in conjunction with Kerberos, it applies as a backup protocol to be used if there is a problem with Kerberos authentication. If enabled, the NTLM protocol is used if one of the systems involved in authentication cannot use Kerberos authentication, is configured improperly, or if the client application does not provide sufficient information to use Kerberos. If NTLM is not enabled, and there is a problem with the Kerberos authentication, the bind (using GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO) to RadiantOne fails. Also, by using NTLM, RadiantOne is able to support cross-domain authentication. This means, that a user that is not logged into the same domain that RadiantOne is a member of (or a domain that is trusted by the RadiantOne domain) can still access RadiantOne and benefit from NTLM for authentication. RadiantOne supports NTLM v2.</p>\n<p>Like all challenge-response protocols, the password is not sent over the protocol but the challenge instead. Since NTLM relies on the domain controller to authenticate its users, RadiantOne needs to know on which domain controller the challenge is generated before sending the challenge back to the user. This information can typically be retrieved from user’s request. If the domain information is not passed, RadiantOne takes the default one to generate the challenge. The first domain listed in the NT Domain parameter is the default one. The diagram below depicts the architecture and process flows.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62.18181818181818%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"RadiantOne Support for NTLM Authentication\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/eed3901f368917eedc97c805e8e64fa3/b966c/Image3.100.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/eed3901f368917eedc97c805e8e64fa3/c1cfe/Image3.100.jpg 275w,\n/static/eed3901f368917eedc97c805e8e64fa3/67061/Image3.100.jpg 550w,\n/static/eed3901f368917eedc97c805e8e64fa3/b966c/Image3.100.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 18: RadiantOne Support for NTLM Authentication</p>\n<p>In the figure above, since the client is accessing RadiantOne from domain B and VDS has been “kerberized” in domain A (and domain A and B do not trust each other), Kerberos cannot be used for authentication. However, NTLM can. The NTLM authentication flow is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Client binds to RadiantOne - The client sends an LDAP bind request to RadiantOne via GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO along with an NTLM Type 1 Message {e.g. NT_Domain=‘DOMAINB' Workstation='W-RLI06-MACHINE1' }</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne requests an NTLM challenge message. RadiantOne requests an NTLM challenge from the required domain controller. RadiantOne knows which domain controller to send the request to because of the NT_Domain property that came in the bind request. If the NT_Domain property is not passed, RadiantOne uses the first one configured in the NT Domain property list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Domain controller responds with a challenge. The domain controller generates a challenge, and sends it to RadiantOne.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne sends the challenge message to client. The challenge message includes an LDAP bind response code 14 (SASL_BIND_IN_PROGRESS). This indicates the server requires the client to send a new bind request, with the same SASL mechanism, to continue the authentication process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Client sends response message. The client then issues a new bind request via GSS-SPNEGO along with an NTLM Type 3 Message {e.g. Username='test5' NT_Domain=‘DOMAINB' }.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne requests domain controller validate the challenge and response. RadiantOne sends the username, the original challenge, and the response from the client computer to the domain controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Domain controller compares challenge and response to authenticate user. The domain controller obtains the password hash for the user, and then uses this hash to encrypt the original challenge. Next, the domain controller compares the encrypted challenge with the response from the client computer. If they match, the domain controller sends RadiantOne confirmation that the user is authenticated. Otherwise, user is not authenticated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne sends bind response to the client. Assuming valid credentials, RadiantOne grants the client access.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To enable NTLM:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check the NTLM Authentication option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each domain that should be supported needs to be configured in this list.

After you have configured the default domain, click <strong>ADD</strong> to add any additional domains that are required.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nChanging any of these parameters requires a restart of the RadiantOne service. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>NT Domain</strong></p>\n<p>A unique domain name that a client may belong to (connecting to RadiantOne from). If the client is not connecting to RadiantOne from the same domain (or a trusted domain), then their domain must be configured otherwise they cannot connect to RadiantOne.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Principal Suffix</strong></p>\n<p>The “Kerberos style” realm that corresponds to the above NT domain.</p>\n<p><strong>DC IP Address</strong></p>\n<p>Enter the IP address of the domain controller you configured in the NT Domain property.</p>\n<p><strong>DC Host BIOS Name</strong></p>\n<p>Enter the host name (NETBIOS name) of the machine hosting the NT Domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Computer Account</strong></p>\n<p>RadiantOne must have a service account (defined as a computer account) in the NT Domain. If the RadiantOne host machine joined an Active Directory (AD) domain, the domain controller should have already generated a Computer account for your host. It is under the node \"CN=Computer, DC=<code class=\"language-text\">&lt;domain></code>\" in AD. However, RadiantOne does not require a physical Computer account to run NTLMv2. It can be a service account but it must be defined under the \"CN=Computers\" container. To create a service/computer account in your NT Domain, from the Active Directory Users and Computers interface, right-click on the \"CN=Computers\" node. Choose 'New' and then click on 'Computer'. Follow the wizard to create a service computer account.</p>\n<p>The Computer Account value you enter in the Main Control Panel must be in format of: <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;computer_name>$@&lt;domain></code>\r\ne.g. <code class=\"language-text\">NTLMv2$@testad.com</code></p>\n<p><strong>Computer Account Password</strong></p>\n<p>The password for the RadiantOne service/computer account in the NT Domain should be entered here. Assigning or resetting the password for a computer account can be done with ADSIEdit. From the Active Directory domain controller machine, launch ADSIEdit (run adsiedit.msc). Browse to the Computer account, right click on it, and choose \"Reset Password\". The password can be entered here. Also update this password for the computer account password property in the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<p><strong>IP Range</strong></p>\n<p>This list defines the IP Addresses for the clients that are authenticated to this configured domain controller. IP Range is required for all configured domains except the default one.</p>\n<p>If the client can send the Domain information to RadiantOne in the Type 1 message, RadiantOne would be able to choose which domain controller to generate the corresponding challenge, which is embedded in the Type 2 message sent back to client. If the client is not able to indicate the Domain in the Type 1 message, RadiantOne references the IP ranges configured and determine the relevant domain. If based on the configured IP ranges (across all configured domains), RadiantOne cannot determine which domain to use, it uses the default one.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Principal Name Mapping</strong></p>\n<p>After authentication via NTLM, authorization (access permissions) must be determined. Client Principal Name Mapping can be used to set up a mapping between the user who authenticates using NTLM and a user DN. The DN is required to set access permissions and for RadiantOne to enforce authorization. If no client principal name mappings are configured (or the ones configured fail to link the username to a valid DN in the virtual tree), then RadiantOne allows <a href=\"access-control#allow-anonymous-access\">anonymous access</a> (you must make sure anonymous access is allowed). To configure the mapping, click <strong>Change</strong> next to the Client Principal Name Mapping parameter.</p>\n<p>There are three different ways to determine the DN from the user ID received in the LDAP bind (using regular expression syntax). Each is described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting a specific User ID to DN. In this example, if lcallahan were received in the authentication request, RadiantOne would base the authorization on the DN: cn=laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">lcallahan (the user ID) -> (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify a DN Suffix, replacing the $1 value with the User ID.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) -> uid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com</code></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) represents the value coming into RadiantOne from the bind operation. If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan, then the DN it bases authorization on is: uid=lcallahan,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com.</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the User ID received in the bind request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+) -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan from the bind request, it would issue a search like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)</code></p>\n<p>The user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the RadiantOne namespace and to base authorization decisions on.</p>\n<p>For options 2 and 3 described above, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the examples). Let’s take a look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(.+)@(.+).(.+).com -> ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=$1)(dc=$3))</code></p>\n<p>If RadiantOne received a user ID like <a href=\"mailto:laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com\">laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com</a>, the search that would be issued would look like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))</code></p>\n<p>The user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identity the user entry in the virtual namespace and to base authorization decisions on.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see <a href=\"interception#processing-multiple-mapping-rules\">Processing Multiple Mapping Rules</a>.</p>\n<p>Changing any NTLM-related parameters requires a restart of RadiantOne. Click <strong>Save</strong> prior to restarting. If deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"md5\">MD5</h3>\n<p>If desired, an LDAP client can send RadiantOne a hashed password using Digest MD5 for authentication. RadiantOne must have access to the password in clear. When the password is received, RadiantOne uses the Digest MD5 hashing algorithm to encrypt it and compare to the value received from the client. If the compare succeeds, the bind was successful. Otherwise, the bind fails.</p>\n<p>To enable MD5 authentication, check the MD5 Authentication box from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section.</p>\n<p>Changing any MD5-related settings requires a restart of the RadiantOne service after saving the new settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Server Fully Qualified Name</strong></p>\n<p>Enter the Server fully qualified name for the machine running RadiantOne (&#x3C;machine_name>.&#x3C;domain_name>).</p>\n<p><strong>Client User Name Mapping</strong></p>\n<p>After authentication via MD5, authorization (access permissions) must be determined. Client User Name Mapping can be used to set up a mapping between the user who authenticates using MD5 and a user DN in the virtual namespace. The DN is required to set access permissions and for RadiantOne to enforce authorization. If no client user name mappings are configured (or the ones configured fail to link the user name to a valid DN in the virtual tree), then RadiantOne allows <a href=\"access-control#allow-anonymous-access\">anonymous access</a> (you must make sure anonymous access is allowed).

The parameter is configured on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods. The values are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>None</strong>\r\n<br>There are no restrictions on what authentication method a client uses. This is the default.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple</strong>\r\n<br>The bind rule is evaluated to be true if the client is accessing the directory using a username and password.</p>\n<p><strong>SSL</strong>\r\n<br>The client must bind to the directory over an SSL/TLS or STARTTLS connection. The bind rule is evaluated to be true if the client authenticates to the directory by using simple authentication (bind DN and password) or with a certificate over LDAPS.</p>\n<p><strong>SASL</strong>\r\n<br>The bind rule is evaluated to be true if the client authenticates to the directory by using one of the following SASL mechanisms: DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI, EXTERNAL or GSS-SPNEGO.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple LDAP Bind</strong>\r\n<br>For accounts stored in Universal Directory (HDAP) stores, the following table lists the potential LDAP response codes returned during bind operations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Condition</th>\n<th>Bind Response Error Code and Message</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>User Name and Password are Correct.

This is useful for limiting exposure to abuse from request flooding that might result from a misconfigured client or from maliciousness. If enabled, the filter keeps track of the number of requests per second from a connection. If a limit is exceeded, the request is either rejected, delayed, or throttled.</p>\n<p>Requests in excess of the per-second limit are throttled by being queued for delayed processing, and eventually rejected altogether if they continue to accumulate.  An unthrottled request is processed immediately without intervention by the filter.</p>\n<p>To enable DoS filtering:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the Main Control Panel, navigate to Settings > Security > DoS Filter. The DoS Filter page is displayed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make changes to the following settings as required.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Click Enable DoS Filter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Requests per Second per Connection – The maximum number of requests from a connection per second. Requests above this limit will be delayed for processing and eventually dropped if they continue to accumulate. The default value is 25.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minimum Delay in Milliseconds – Over-limit requests will be delayed this long before being processed. Set to -1 to immediately discard over-limit requests, or set to 0 for no delay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Over-limit Requests Pending – After Max Requests per Second per Connection + Throttled Requests total requests within a one-second period is reached, additional messages are ignored and discarded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Processing Time in Milliseconds – The maximum allowable time to process a request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Idle Tracker in Milliseconds – Sets the maximum amount of time to keep track of request rates for a connection before discarding it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Insert Header – Check this option to insert the Dos filter headers into the response.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track Session – Check this option to have usage rates tracked by session (if a session exists).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track Remote Port – Set this option to have usage rates tracked by IP and port if session tracking is not used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IP Whitelist – Enter a comma-separated list of IP addresses that are not to be rate-limited. Each entry is IP address, either in the form of a dotted decimal notation A.B.C.D or in the CIDR notation A.B.C.D/M</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] RadiantOne FID automatically whitelists all hosts that are members of the cluster so that node-to-node communications are unaffected; these hosts do not need to be added to the whitelist. This whitelist displays only the hosts that are added manually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HTTP Response Code – When the DoS filter cancels the processing of a request, it sends back an HTTP response code. Use this setting to change that code.

These include the level of assurance associated with the authentication method, days and times of the week during which the identity is allowed to authenticate, and location from which the identity must bind (IP or DNS addresses).</p>\n<h4 id=\"level-of-assurance\">Level of Assurance</h4>\n<p>A Level of Assurance, as defined by the ISO/IEC 29115 Standard, describes the degree of confidence in the process leading up to and including an authentication. It provides assurance that the entity claiming a particular identity, is the entity to which that identity was assigned. There are 5 levels of assurance used by RadiantOne to enforce access controls to data. The default level is no enforcement of assurance (Level 0). You can use this level when there is minimum risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.</p>\n<p>Level 1 indicates an authentication method of basic credentials (username+password) is required to access the data. At this level, there is little confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is low risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.</p>\n<p>Level 2 indicates an authentication method of Kerberos (leveraging GSSAPI) is required to access the data. At this level, there is some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is moderate risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nEnsure you have RadiantOne configured properly as a <a href=\"06-security#kerberos\">Kerberos LDAP service</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Level 3 indicates multi-factor authentication (e.g. RSA SecurID token code, Yubikey) is required to access the data. At this level, there is high confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is high risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nEnsure you have RadiantOne configured properly with a <a href=\"interception#custom-authentication-providers\">Custom Authentication Provider</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Level 4 indicates certificate-based (mutual) authentication is required to access the data. There is very high confidence in an asserted identity of the entity. This is the highest level of authentication assurance and should be used when there is very high risk associated with accessing the data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nEnsure you have RadiantOne configured properly for <a href=\"server-backend#mutual-authentication\">Mutual Authentication</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Select the assurance level from the drop-down list and select an operator.

You can allow or deny all operations, or you can assign one or more of the following:</p>\n<p><strong>All</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates that the subject has the following rights to the targeted entry: read, write, search, delete, compare, and selfwrite. The All access right does not give the following rights to the target entry: proxy.</p>\n<p>Example of syntax when all operations are selected:</p>\n<p>(targetattr = \"homePhone\")(target = \"ldap:///dv=address book,o=vds\")(targetfilter = \"(securitylevel=secret)\")(targetscope = \"subtree\")(version 3.0;acl \"myaci\";allow (all) (userdn = \"ldap:///all\");)</p>\n<p><strong>Read</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can read the directory entries and the attributes of entries specified in the ACI. This permission applies only to the search operation.</p>\n<p><strong>Search</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can search on the targets specified in the ACI. This permission applies only to the search operation. The Search right is checked once, and after the search is allowed or denied, it is not checked again. If the search is allowed, the read right is then applied to each entry to be returned as a result of the search and to each attribute of each entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Add</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can create entries.</p>\n<p><strong>Delete</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can delete entries.</p>\n<p><strong>Compare</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can compare data they supply in the request with data stored in the directory. With compare rights, the directory returns a success or failure message in response to an inquiry, but the user cannot see the value of the entry or attribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Write</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can modify an entry by adding, modifying, or deleting attributes. This permission applies to the modify and modRDN operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Self Write</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can add or delete their own DN in an attribute of the target group entry. The syntax of this attribute must be a distinguished name. This right is used only for group management. Self write works with proxy authorization: it grants the right to add or delete the proxy DN from the group entry (not the DN of the user from the Bind operation).</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy</strong></p>\n<p>Authorization for RadiantOne data is checked based on the user who authenticated. The authorization ID (DN) is linked to the authenticated ID (DN) for the same connection. With the proxy authorization control enabled, the client can switch the user ID (for authorization purposes) without having to re-authenticate with a new connection.</p>\n<p>If there is the need to base authorization on a different user than the one who authenticated, you can use the proxy authorization control. This is primarily useful in environments where an application must authenticate many users and doesn’t want to maintain an open connection to RadiantOne for each of them. With this approach, the application can authenticate the user, and after, impersonate that user for authorization purposes. The application can use its own service account when connecting to RadiantOne and pass the needed control along with the user DN of the person they want to represent for authorization in their requests. RadiantOne then checks the proxy authorization rules that have been configured in access controls to make sure the service account is allowed to represent the person passed in their request. If so, the service account is allowed to perform any operations the person they are impersonating would be allowed to do.</p>\n<p>The proxy option indicates whether the subject can access the target with the rights of another entry. You can grant proxy access using the DN of any user in the directory except the special cn=directory manager user. In addition, you cannot grant proxy rights to the cn=directory manager user. If the branch you are protecting with access controls is a local LDAP/HDAP store, then this requires the <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#proxied-authorization-control\">Proxy Authorization control</a> enabled for RadiantOne.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subjects\">Subjects</h3>\n<p>A subject is whom the access control rule applies to. The subject types that can be associated with access control rules are described below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] It is recommended to define access controls on subjects that are located in a RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) store or persistent cache. This prevents possible performance or network issues involved with RadiantOne connecting to a backend directory in order to enforce authorization. If your ACI’s require subjects that are located in backend directories, make sure that the backend is configured for high availability and that the <a href=\"concepts#data-source\">RadiantOne data source</a> is configured with the failover servers appropriately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Users – applicable to any specific user(s).</li>\n<li>Groups – applicable to a group of users. If the group is a nested group in HDAP, enable Main Control Panel > Settings > Security > Access Control > <a href=\"access-control#enable-nested-groups\">Enable Nested Groups</a> and configure <a href=\"interception#linked-attributes\">Linked Attribute</a> settings from Main Control Panel > Settings > Interception > Special Attributes Handling.</li>\n<li>Tree Branch - Applicable to the DN specified as part of the subject and all entries below it in the virtual directory tree. The defined access permissions apply to any user found in the tree branch you choose.</li>\n<li>Public – anyone connected to the directory is considered public. This also includes anonymous users.</li>\n<li>Self – applicable to the user whose authenticated DN matches the DN of the entry that is being accessed.</li>\n<li>Authenticated – applicable to any user who successfully authenticates.</li>\n<li>Parent – applicable to the entry only if their bind DN is the parent of the targeted entry. For example, to allow users to modify any child entries of their bind DN, create the following ACI on the dv=address book,o=vds node:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(targetattr = \"*\")(target = \"ldap:///dv=address book,o=vds\")(targetscope = \"subtree\")(version 3.0;acl \"myaci\";allow (write) (userdn = \"ldap:///parent\");)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP Address – applicable to a specific client IP address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can indicate that a client connection must originate from a single IP address or a range of addresses. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported and you can indicate a range of IP addresses using “/”. A mix of IPv4 and IPv6 can also be used. See below for examples:</p>\n<p><strong>Single IPv4 address</strong>\r\n<br>10.11.12.129</p>\n<p><strong>Single IPv6 address</strong>\r\n<br>fe80::b010:e554:f9d5:dec0%10\r\n<strong>Range of IPv4 addresses (use the “/”) like:</strong>\r\n<br>10.11.12.0/24 which represents the given IPv4 address and its associated routing prefix 10.11.12.0, or equivalently, its subnet mask 255.255.255.0, which has 24 leading 1-bits. This covers the range between 10.11.12.0 to 10.11.12.255.\r\n<strong>Range of IPv6 addresses:</strong>\r\n<br>2001:db8::/32    which covers the range between 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:0 to 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff</p>\n<p>For IPv6 addresses, use the syntax defined by RFC 2373. For example, 0:0:0:0:0:0:13.1.68.3 which can also be expressed as ::13.1.68.3 are both valid forms of IPv6 addresses. An address with a subnet prefix length can also be used (e.g. 12AB::CD30:0:0:0:0/60). Wildcards cannot be used in IPv6 addresses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nTo use DNS addresses, manually edit the ACI after saving it by clicking <strong>Manually Edit</strong>. Use the keyword dns and enter the fully qualified DNS domain name. Use an operator of either “equal to” (=) or “not equal to” (!=). Wildcards are supported in the DNS address.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"aci-evaluation-rules\">ACI Evaluation Rules</h2>\n<p>The ACI evaluation rules that RadiantOne follows are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When the RadiantOne service starts, all ACIs defined in the entries below \"ou=aggregate,ou=globalaci,cn=config\" are loaded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To determine if an operation is allowed or denied, RadiantOne looks in the ACI list for the target of the operation to collect all target-matched aci values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne separates the aci values into two lists; one list contains all the aci values that match the target and denies the required access, and the other list contains all the aci values that match the target and allows the required access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the deny list contains any aci values after this procedure, access is immediately denied.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the deny list is empty, then the allow list is processed. If the allow list contains any aci values, access is allowed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If both lists are empty, access is denied.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nTo troubleshoot/trace ACI evaluation decisions, <a href=\"logs#log-settings\">RadiantOne server log level</a> must be set to DEBUG. When DEBUG level is set, the evaluation rules can be seen in: &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/logs/vds_server.log</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"setting-access-controls\">Setting Access Controls</h2>\n<p>To define access controls:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nAccess rights can be defined by any user who is a member of the ACI Administrators group or the Directory Administrators group.

These settings dictate whether RadiantOne enforces defined access controls, allows anonymous access, requires passwords for bind operations, and if nested groups are supported. Each setting is described in more details below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-aci\">Enable ACI</h3>\n<p>The checking of ACIs by RadiantOne can be enabled or disabled by using the Enable ACI checkbox. Check the box to enable and uncheck to disable. For specific details about setting ACI, please see <a href=\"#security-and-access-controls\">Security and Access Controls</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-anonymous-access\">Allow Anonymous Access</h3>\n<p>If RadiantOne should allow anonymous access, then check the Allow Anonymous Access checkbox. If RadiantOne should not allow anonymous access, make sure this checkbox is not checked. This is the default global access permission for anonymous users and is enforced before subsequent ACI rules. In other words, even if anonymous access were allowed as a general policy, subsequent ACI rules could prevent anonymous users from accessing any data. For details on access controls that can be set, please <a href=\"#security-and-access-controls\">Security and Access Controls</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-directory-manager-to-impersonate-other-users\">Allow Directory Manager to Impersonate Other Users</h3>\n<p>Proxy authorization allows the user that creates a connection to RadiantOne to impersonate/request access on behalf of another user. This allows authorization to be enforced for a user other than the one that creates the connection/binds to RadiantOne. By default, the RadiantOne super user (e.g. cn=directory manager) is not allowed to impersonate other users. If you want this special user to be able to impersonate other users (to enforce authorization based on other users instead of as the super user), enable the “Allow Directory Manager to Impersonate Other Users” option. Also, verify that the <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#proxied-authorization-control\">Proxy Authorization Control</a> is enabled for RadiantOne because this is the control that allows clients to request access on behalf of another user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bind-requires-ssl-or-starttls\">Bind Requires SSL or StartTLS</h3>\n<p>If a user binds to RadiantOne and provides a password, that password is vulnerable to interception by a third party when sent over non-SSL ports. To help prevent this vulnerability, you can enforce that binds always use the SSL/TLS ports by using the Bind requires SSL or StartTLS option.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] As a best practice, it is recommended that you only allow SSL communication to the RadiantOne service. If you require non-SSL communication but still want to require that binds use SSL or StartTLS, you can use this option.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This option requires enabling SSL.

This may introduce security problems for the client application, or in certain cases where machines like printers may bind against RadiantOne, that do not verify that the client actually provided a password. If the Bind Requires Password setting is enabled, and no password is specified in the bind request, RadiantOne tries to bind the specified user and return an invalid credential error to the client. If Bind Requires Password is not enabled, and a bind request comes in with a valid user DN and no password, it is considered an anonymous bind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-nested-groups\">Enable Nested Groups</h3>\n<p>If you have groups stored in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store and want to support groups as members, check the Enable Nested Groups option.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] Processing nested groups is not efficient and is not enabled by default. When nested groups are used in RadiantOne ACLs for access controls, many recursive searches are required. Large groups with a mix of many members including other groups as members can have poor performance. Use nested groups with caution and validate your use case with performance testing to ensure response times meet your needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"ldap_matching_rule_in_chain\">LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne supports the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN operator and allows clients to issue search filters using the 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941 matching rule OID. This provides a method to look up the ancestry of an object and can be used in a search filter to retrieve all groups a user is a member of even when that group is nested (and is a member of another group). If the base DN in the RadiantOne namespace is associated with a proxy view, the search filter containing the matching rule OID is passed to the backend which must process the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN. If the base DN in the RadiantOne namespace is associated with a persistent cache or a Universal Directory store, RadiantOne processes the matching rule locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] If you are using the Linked Attributes calculation in RadiantOne and the users and groups are local, in a persistent cache or Universal Directory store, you must enable the Optimize Linked Attribute setting to support filters requesting isMemberOf/memberOf. This ensures good performance. For details on this setting, see the Namespace Configuration Guide (applicable to RadiantOne Universal Directory stores) or the <a href=\"/deployment-and-tuning-guide/00-preface\">RadiantOne Deployment and Tuning Guide</a> (applicable to persistent cache).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 237px; display:inline-block; width: 237px; pointer-events:none; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 12.658227848101264%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/be46ae4f38b4ab6e9a25650017c3a1f6/8fe27/Image3.112.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/be46ae4f38b4ab6e9a25650017c3a1f6/8fe27/Image3.112.jpg 237w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>As a simple example, assume there is a group named All Users and that this group is a member of another group named Sales.

These settings dictate whether RadiantOne enforces defined access controls, allows anonymous access, requires passwords for bind operations, and if nested groups are supported. Each setting is described in more details below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-aci-1\">Enable ACI</h3>\n<p>The checking of ACIs by RadiantOne can be enabled or disabled by using the Enable ACI checkbox. Check the box to enable and uncheck to disable. For specific details about setting ACI, please see <a href=\"#security-and-access-controls\">Security and Access Controls</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-anonymous-access-1\">Allow Anonymous Access</h3>\n<p>If RadiantOne should allow anonymous access, then check the Allow Anonymous Access checkbox. If RadiantOne should not allow anonymous access, make sure this checkbox is not checked. This is the default global access permission for anonymous users and is enforced before subsequent ACI rules. In other words, even if anonymous access were allowed as a general policy, subsequent ACI rules could prevent anonymous users from accessing any data. For details on access controls that can be set, please <a href=\"#security-and-access-controls\">Security and Access Controls</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-directory-manager-to-impersonate-other-users-1\">Allow Directory Manager to Impersonate Other Users</h3>\n<p>Proxy authorization allows the user that creates a connection to RadiantOne to impersonate/request access on behalf of another user. This allows authorization to be enforced for a user other than the one that creates the connection/binds to RadiantOne. By default, the RadiantOne super user (e.g. cn=directory manager) is not allowed to impersonate other users. If you want this special user to be able to impersonate other users (to enforce authorization based on other users instead of as the super user), enable the “Allow Directory Manager to Impersonate Other Users” option. Also, verify that the <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#proxied-authorization-control\">Proxy Authorization Control</a> is enabled for RadiantOne because this is the control that allows clients to request access on behalf of another user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bind-requires-ssl-or-starttls-1\">Bind Requires SSL or StartTLS</h3>\n<p>If a user binds to RadiantOne and provides a password, that password is vulnerable to interception by a third party when sent over non-SSL ports. To help prevent this vulnerability, you can enforce that binds always use the SSL/TLS ports by using the Bind requires SSL or StartTLS option.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nAs a best practice, it is recommended that you only allow SSL communication to the RadiantOne service. If you require non-SSL communication but still want to require that binds use SSL or StartTLS, you can use this option.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This option requires enabling SSL.

This may introduce security problems for the client application, or in certain cases where machines like printers may bind against RadiantOne, that do not verify that the client actually provided a password. If the Bind Requires Password setting is enabled, and no password is specified in the bind request, RadiantOne tries to bind the specified user and return an invalid credential error to the client. If Bind Requires Password is not enabled, and a bind request comes in with a valid user DN and no password, it is considered an anonymous bind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-nested-groups-1\">Enable Nested Groups</h3>\n<p>If you have groups stored in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store and want to support groups as members, check the Enable Nested Groups option.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nProcessing nested groups is not efficient and is not enabled by default. When nested groups are used in RadiantOne ACLs for access controls, many recursive searches are required. Large groups with a mix of many members including other groups as members can have poor performance. Use nested groups with caution and validate your use case with performance testing to ensure response times meet your needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"ldap_matching_rule_in_chain-1\">LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne supports the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN operator and allows clients to issue search filters using the 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941 matching rule OID. This provides a method to look up the ancestry of an object and can be used in a search filter to retrieve all groups a user is a member of even when that group is nested (and is a member of another group). If the base DN in the RadiantOne namespace is associated with a proxy view, the search filter containing the matching rule OID is passed to the backend which must process the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN. If the base DN in the RadiantOne namespace is associated with a persistent cache or a Universal Directory store, RadiantOne processes the matching rule locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf you are using the Linked Attributes calculation in RadiantOne and the users and groups are local, in a persistent cache or Universal Directory store, you must enable the Optimize Linked Attribute setting to support filters requesting isMemberOf/memberOf. This ensures good performance. For details on this setting, see the Namespace Configuration Guide (applicable to RadiantOne Universal Directory stores) or the <a href=\"/deployment-and-tuning-guide/00-preface\">RadiantOne Deployment and Tuning Guide</a> (applicable to persistent cache).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 237px; display:inline-block; width: 237px; pointer-events:none; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 12.658227848101264%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/be46ae4f38b4ab6e9a25650017c3a1f6/8fe27/Image3.112.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/be46ae4f38b4ab6e9a25650017c3a1f6/8fe27/Image3.112.jpg 237w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>As a simple example, assume there is a group named All Users and that this group is a member of another group named Sales.

Therefore, any time you change the RadiantOne server certificate, you must import the corresponding public key certificate into the Client Certificate Trust Store (unless the signer of the server certificate is already trusted).</p>\n<p>Also, the certificates in the Client Certificate Trust Store are used by RadiantOne to connect via SSL to underlying data sources. Therefore, the appropriate client (public key) certificate (associated with the server certificate of the backend) needs imported into the Client Certificate Trust Store (unless they are signed by a trusted/known Certificate Authority).</p>\n<p>RadiantOne loads all client certificates from the default Java truststore (&#x3C;RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts) when it starts. Then, it dynamically loads all other certificates from the Client Certificate Trust Store. This allows client certificates to be dynamically added at any time without needing to restart the RadiantOne service. When RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, all nodes share the contents of the Client Certificate Trust Store.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nIt is not recommended to import client certificates into the default Java truststore (&#x3C;RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts) since this is overwritten each time there is a RadiantOne patch that requires a Java update and requires a restart of the RadiantOne service every time you add new certificates. For these reasons, it is recommended to use the RadiantOne Client Certificate Trust Store instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Import client certificates into the truststore from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Client Certificate Truststore.

Enter a policy name applicable to the intended usage and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>\n<p>The ‘Subject’ of the custom policy can be either Sub-tree or Group and is based on a specific base DN. Click <strong>CHOOSE</strong> to select a base DN. If the subject is set to sub-tree, this means that all user entries below the chosen base DN (which must be a RadiantOne Universal Directory store or persistent cache) are affected by the custom policy. If the subject is set to group, this means that all users that are a member of the group specified in the base DN are affected by the custom policy. The group DN can represent a static group (unique members listed in the group entry) or a dynamic group (associated with the groupOfURLs object class and contains a memberURL attribute dictating the members). RadiantOne evaluates dynamic membership automatically to enforce password policies. If a user is affected by a policy defined for sub-tree and for group, the one associated with the group takes precedence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Custom policy properties override those defined in the default policy. The only exception is the password content properties where you can choose to enable the enforcement of the custom policy, or choose to use the default policy. Keep in mind that a value of 0 (zero) in a custom policy for password content means an unlimited amount is allowed. It does not mean that it is undefined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An example of a custom password policy is shown below. It is applicable to all users who are located in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store and are a member of the Special Users group identified in the DIT as cn=special users,ou=globalgroups,cn=config.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] If you define multiple custom password policies associated with groups (as the Subject), they should not have the same precedence if they share members. If a user is affected by multiple group-based policies, the one with the highest precedence (lowest numeric value in the precedence setting) is enforced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 32%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Example Custom Password Policy Applicable to a Group\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/b966c/Image3.104.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/c1cfe/Image3.104.jpg 275w,\n/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/67061/Image3.104.jpg 550w,\n/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/b966c/Image3.104.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 49: Example Custom Password Policy Applicable to a Group</p>\n<p>An example of a custom password policy applicable to all users below a specific container is shown below.

From the Main Control Panel, you can indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). A value of 1d 5h 45m would indicate a password expires after 1 day, 5 hours and 45 minutes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Your password policy must uphold the following rule: pwdMinAge + pwdExpireWarning &#x3C; pwdMaxAge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If a user’s password is expired, the next time a client (on the user’s behalf) connects to RadiantOne, the bind will fail and the additional information returned to the client indicates the password has expired. An example using an ldapsearch command line client by a user identified as “tuser” is shown below.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ldapsearch -h 10.11.12.164 -p 2389 -D \"uid=tuser,ou=people,o=global\" -w password -b \"o=global\" \"(uid=tuser)\"</code>\r\n<br><code class=\"language-text\">ldap_simple_bind: Invalid credentials</code>\r\n<br><code class=\"language-text\">ldap_simple_bind: additional info: Password has expired.</code></p>\n<p>During the bind, RadiantOne calculates if the user’s password has expired and returns the bind response and additional information to the client. It is up to the client to prompt the user to reset their password, if this functionality is desired.</p>\n<p>The user entry stored in RadiantOne doesn’t contain an attribute that indicates a user’s password has expired. However, the entry contains an attribute (passwordExpWarned) indicating when the password expiring warning was send in the bind response.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">dn: uid=tuser,ou=people,o=global</code>\r\n<br><code class=\"language-text\">passwordExpWarned: 20170622194148.238Z</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"send-a-warning-before-the-password-expires\">Send a warning before the password expires</h3>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdExpireWarning attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. It contains the amount of time before a password is due to expire in which case an expiration warning message is returned to an authenticating user. From the Main Control Panel, you can indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). A value of 1d would indicate a password expiration warning should be sent 1 day prior to the password expiring.</p>\n<p>If this attribute is not present, or if the value is 0d no warnings are returned. If not 0d, the value must be smaller than the value of the pwdMaxAge attribute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Your password policy must uphold the following rule: pwdMinAge + pwdExpireWarning &#x3C; pwdMaxAge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When this is configured, a control is returned with the BindResponse (even if the client doesn’t specifically request it) indicating the amount of time until expiration. An example is shown below.</p>\n<p>PasswordExpiringControl {2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.5 false secondsUntilExpiration=432000}</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-a-certain-number-of-login-attempts-after-the-password-expires\">Allow a certain number of login attempts after the password expires</h3>\n<p>These are known as grace logins. The value of this parameter is stored in the pwdGraceAuthNLimit attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. The parameter specifies the number of times an expired password can be used to authenticate. If this attribute is not present, or if the value is 0, authentication fails if the password has expired.</p>\n<p>During the grace login attempts, bind requests are processed. However, the subsequent operation after the bind must be a modifyRequest to change the password. Otherwise, an error message is returned indicating “You must change your password before submitting any other requests”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"password-content\">Password Content</h2>\n<p>The following are the password content options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Password minimum length</li>\n<li>Minimum required digit (0-9) characters</li>\n<li>Minimum required uppercase (A-Z) characters</li>\n<li>Minimum required lowercase (a-z) characters</li>\n<li>Minimum required special characters</li>\n<li>Password encryption</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If more complex password content is required, the Password Strength Rule can be used.</p>\n<p>Each of these properties is described below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 35.63636363636363%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Password Content and Account Lockout Options\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a681d754aea01e2b98388c7f692097cd/b966c/Image3.108.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a681d754aea01e2b98388c7f692097cd/c1cfe/Image3.108.jpg 275w,\n/static/a681d754aea01e2b98388c7f692097cd/67061/Image3.108.jpg 550w,\n/static/a681d754aea01e2b98388c7f692097cd/b966c/Image3.108.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 53: Password Content and Account Lockout Options</p>\n<h3 id=\"enabled\">Enabled</h3>\n<p>This option is only applicable to custom password policies.</p>\n<p>Custom policies can enforce specific password content criteria or inherit from the default policy.

This option requires enabling both “User must change password after reset” and “Require existing password in order to change password” in the Password Change section of the password policy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] This leverages the Damerau Levenshtein algorithm to determine the variation of characters between the old and new passwords.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"restrictions-on-using-accountname-or-username\">Restrictions on Using Accountname or Username</h3>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdEnableNotContainNames attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and has a value of true or false. If true, the user’s password must not contain the user’s accoutname or parts of the user’s full name that exceed two consecutive characters.</p>\n<p>For the accountname value, the sAMAccountname attribute is checked first. If sAMAccountname is not found, the uid attribute is checked. If uid is not found, rdn value is checked. For the user’s full name, the attribute displayName is checked. If displayName is not present, cn is checked. If the cn attribute is not found, the full name is computed (givenName+sn) and checked. These checks are not case-sensitive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"password-encryption\">Password Encryption</h3>\n<p>The passwords that are stored in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store may be hashed using any of the following methods: Clear, CRYPT, MD5, PBKDF2AD, Salted SHA-1, Salted SHA-256, Salted SHA-384, Salted SHA-512, and SHA-1. The least secure methods of CRYPT, MD5, and SHA-1 have been hidden as options from the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] PBKDF2AD is the required password encryption expected in Azure AD. Therefore, if your HDAP store (or persistent cache) will be synchronized to Azure AD, and passwords are a part of the synchronization, use the PBKDF2AD encryption option to store passwords in the RadiantOne Universal Directory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"automatic-update-to-stronger-password-hash\">Automatic Update to Stronger Password Hash</h3>\n<p>If the “Update stored passwords to stronger encryption after successful bind” is enabled, user accounts that contain a password hashed with a less secure method than allowed for the current password policy are automatically updated to the stronger hash after a successful bind. The only exception to this is for passwords that have a current hash of: PKCS5S2, PBKDF2, PBKDF2AD, SCRYPT, BCRYPT, SMD4, or MD4, in which case the hashing is not changed. This value is stored in the pwdEnableAlgorithmUpgrade attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and has a value of True or False.</p>\n<p>The strength order is as follows:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">CLEAR -> CRYPT -> MD5 -> SHA1 -> SSHA1 -> SHA256 -> SSHA256 -> SHA384 -> SSHA384 -> SHA512 -> SSHA512 -> (PKCS5S2 | PBKDF2 | PBKDF2AD | SCRYPT | BCRYPT | SMD4 | MD4)</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] PKCS5S2, PBKDF2, PBKDF2AD, SCRYPT, BCRYPT, SMD4, and MD4 are considered as special hashes of the strongest ranking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"password-strength-rule\">Password Strength Rule</h3>\n<p>The default options for enforcing password content are based on an AND operation. For example, if you set a minimum password length, minimum number of required digits, and a minimum number of required uppercase letters, the rule would be expressed as follows.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;min password length> AND &lt;min # of digits> AND &lt;min # uppercase letters>.</code></p>\n<p>The Password Strength Rule option allows you to define and test password strength requirements that are more complex using an OR condition. For example, you could use the Password Strength Rule option to require a password to have 'n' number of special characters OR 'n' number of Upper Case characters. In another example, a password strength rule requiring at least six total characters, with at least one lower case, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit OR one symbol would be expressed in the Password Strength Rule field as follows.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">^.(?=.{6,})(?=.[a-z])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[\\d\\W]).*$</code></p>\n<p>Another example would be if you do not want to allow special characters to be used in the password. This would be expressed in the Password Strength Rule field as:\r\n<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>+$</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Checking the Password Strength Rule box disables and overrides all other password Content options except Password minimum length and Password encryption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Enter your password strength rule using regular expression syntax.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Test</strong> to compile your expression.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-dictionary-check\">Enable Dictionary Check</h3>\n<p>The Enable Dictionary Check option is comparable to the Strong Password Check plug-in found in legacy LDAP directories. This enables RadiantOne to verify that a user’s password doesn’t contain unallowed strings from a specified dictionary file. This can be used as a method to enforce strong password policies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] The default behavior uses an exact match comparison of the password to a dictionary value. To enforce a contains match comparison, go to the Main Control Panel > Zookeeper tab, navigate to <code class=\"language-text\">/radiantone/&lt;version>/&lt;clusterName>/config/vds_server.conf</code> and click EDIT MODE. Set the following: \"enablePwdPolicyDictionarySubstringCheck\" : true <BR> The value of “true” must be in all lowercase, as shown above. <BR>You can also set this property using the vdsconfig command line utility, set-property command. For details, see the <a href=\"/command-line-configuration-guide/01-introduction\">Radiantone Command Line Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To enable this feature:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From Main Control Panel, navigate to the Settings tab >Security > Password policies section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Locate the Password Content section and check the option to Enable Dictionary Check. This value is stored in the pwdEnableDictionary attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and has a value of True or False.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Browse</strong> to navigate to the dictionary file. The value for the location of the dictionary file is stored in the pwdDictionaryFile attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The dictionary file must be a text-formatted file containing one dictionary word per line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"account-activity-and-lockout\">Account Activity and Lockout</h2>\n<p>Accounts may be automatically locked under two circumstances:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If a user has not authenticated successfully to RadiantOne for longer than a specified period of time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a user has reached the failed login threshold.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"keep-track-of-users-last-successful-login-time\">Keep Track of User’s Last Successful Login Time</h3>\n<p>If you want to keep track of a user’s last successful login time, enable the option to “Keep track of the user’s last successful logon time” in the Account Activity section of the password policy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] You can exclude pwdLastLogonTime changes from the RadiantOne changelog by setting the following property in ZooKeeper at /radiantone/&#x3C;Config_Version>/&#x3C;RadiantOne_ClusterName>/config/vds_server.conf: \"skipLoggingIntoChangelogForPwdLastLogonTime\" : \"true\", <BR> This alleviates excessive writing into the changelog when you have a large volume of user login activity. This property is enforced globally and affects all password policies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can indicate the frequency that RadiantOne records the time of the last successful authentication. The default value is 0s meaning that the last login time is updated on every successful authentication. To change the default, indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). For example, a value of 1d indicates the last login time is updated if at least 1 day has passed since the last successful authentication. Subsequent successful authentications, within this time frame, do not change the last login time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] There is a performance impact on RadiantOne if you keep track of last successful logins because a write operation is performed with a successful bind. It is recommended that you indicate a frequency for writing the last login and that you test the usage of this feature to determine if the degradation in performance is acceptable for your usage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If accounts should be automatically locked when a user has not authenticated successfully for a predetermined amount of time, indicate the threshold (number of days) in the “Account Activity” section of the password policy where you see “Lock user’s account if the user is idle longer than <X> days”. The user’s password must be reset to unlock the account. Once the account is unlocked, if it is not used for login longer than the specified time, the account is locked again. If the value is zero days, this means users will never be locked out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lock-accounts-based-on-number-of-failed-logins\">Lock Accounts Based on Number of Failed Logins</h3>\n<p>If accounts should be locked out after a failed login threshold is met, check the Accounts may be locked out option in the password policy, and establish the criteria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How may login failures are allowed? Enter this value for X (Lockout account after X login failures).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdMaxFailure attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and contains the number of failed login attempts to allow. This corresponds to the operational attribute for the user entry named pwdFailureTime which stores the time(s) of the login failure(s).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How often to reset the failure count? Enter this value for X (Reset failure count after X minutes).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdFailureCountInterval attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. This is the temporary interval of time in which RadiantOne keeps track of the number of failed login attempts. For example, if the number of login failures allowed is 2 and the reset failure account is 5 minutes, this means if a user login fails twice within 5 minutes, the account will be locked. If the user logs in unsuccessfully once and then doesn’t try again until after the 5-minute interval has passed, the number of unsuccessful login attempts is reset and the new failed login attempt counts as the first failure instead of the second failure. This relates to the number of values for the pwdFailureTime operational attribute in the user’s entry which is used to determine how many failed logins have been attempted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Once an account is locked, the reset failure count is irrelevant in terms of determining how many failed login attempts have occurred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How long is an account locked out?\r\n<br>Lockout forever\r\n<br>Lockout duration X minutes</p>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdLockoutDuration attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. This relates to the operational attribute <a href=\"#pwdaccountlockedtime\">pwdAccountLockedTime</a> in the user’s entry which includes a timestamp indicating when the user’s account became locked. Once a lockout duration has passed, or a user’s password has been reset by an administrator, the account is unlocked. Any user (other than the locked out user) that has the proper permissions (ACI’s) can reset the user’s password.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"unlocking-accounts\">Unlocking Accounts</h3>\n<p>If a user’s account is locked, it can become unlocked by resetting the user’s password. Any user (other than the locked out user) that has the proper permissions (ACI’s) can reset the user’s password. If the lockout policy has a duration period, the account is automatically unlocked after the duration has passed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"operational-password-attributes-stored-in-user-entries\">Operational Password Attributes Stored in User Entries</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] Since these attributes are defined as operational attributes, they do not appear in the user entries unless specifically requested in the search from the client.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"pwdhistory\">pwdHistory</h3>\n<p>Stores the previous values used for passwords to prevent users from re-using previous passwords.

RadiantOne does not write to this attribute or allow password policies to be defined on individual users from the Main Control Panel. However, if the entry was imported from another directory, this attribute could have a value that dictates which password policy affects the user. If the value matches a policy defined in RadiantOne, this policy is enforced for the user. If the value does not match a policy defined in RadiantOne it is ignored and other configured policies below cn=Password Policy,cn=config are checked. If multiple policies affect the user, the one with the highest priority (based on precedence level) is enforced.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pwdreset\">pwdReset</h3>\n<p>A Boolean attribute containing the value TRUE if the password has been reset and must be changed by the user. If a user’s password is set/reset by the RadiantOne super user (e.g. cn=directory manager), a member of the cn=directory administrators group (cn=directory administrators,ou=globalgroups,cn=config), or the user himself, this does not trigger pwdReset set to TRUE. Only when a user’s password is set/reset by other users (e.g. helpdesk) is the pwdReset set to TRUE. When the affected user logs in with the new password for the first time, they are not allowed to perform operations until they reset their password. For example, if the user attempts a search, RadiantOne responds with error code 53 and a message indicating “You must change your password before submitting any other requests”. After the user updates their password, pwdReset is removed from their entry.</p>\n<p>If a user resets their password, RadiantOne performs the following checks based on the password policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check if the user is allowed to change their password</li>\n<li>Check minimum password age</li>\n<li>Check if old password is provided with new password (if the “Require Existing Password in order to Change Password” policy is enabled)</li>\n<li>Check the password length</li>\n<li>Check the password quality (correct number of required characters – upper/lower/number…etc.)</li>\n<li>Check if the password is in the history</li>\n<li>Check if the password contains unallowed strings based on a dictionary file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the BIND response is returned, it is up to the client to prompt the user accordingly (depending on what kind of password policy response or control was returned).</p>\n<p>RadiantOne returns one of the following responses to the client application:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Modify Response Code</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>53</td>\n<td>User password changes are not allowed.

This allows for limiting the number of entries LDAP clients can receive from a query. By default this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on the size.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThis parameter is a global parameter for RadiantOne. If you want more granular, specific size limits set, then you should set them in the Custom Limits sections.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"time-limit\">Time Limit</h3>\n<p>The time (in seconds) during which a search operation is expected to finish. If a search operation does not finish within this time parameter, the query is aborted. By default, this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"look-through-limit\">Look Through Limit</h3>\n<p>The look through limit is the maximum number of entries you want the server to check in response to a search request. You should use this value to limit the number of entries the server will look through to find an entry. This limits the processing and time spent by the server to respond to potentially bogus search requests (for example, if a client sends a search filter based on an attribute that is not indexed). By default, this is set to 0, which means that there is no limit set for the number of entries that the server will look through.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThis property is not used by RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) stores.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"idle-timeout\">Idle Timeout</h3>\n<p>The length of time (in seconds) to keep a connection open without any activity from the client. The default is 900, which means the idle connection is kept open for 900 seconds and then closed by the server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"custom-limits\">Custom Limits</h2>\n<p>Custom limits are more fine-grained than global limits and can be defined in the Main Control Panel > Settings > Limits > Custom Limits section. Custom limits can be configured for the pre-defined users: “Anonymous Users”, and “Authenticated Users”. They can also be more granular and associated with users belonging to any group or located below any branch/naming context (subtree) in RadiantOne.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nMultiple custom limits are not allowed for anonymous users and authenticated users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Custom limits override any Global Limits defined in the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Limits section > Global Limits sub-section. The order of precedence (highest to lowest) for global and custom limits containing the same subject is: Group, Sub-tree, Authenticated Users, Anonymous Users, Global. For custom limits defined within the same root naming context, the limit defined for the deepest entry in the tree will take precedence. For example, if a custom size limit of 3 is defined for a subject location of ou=Novato,ou=California,dc=USA and a size limit of 5 is defined for a subject location of ou=California,dc=USA, if a user of uid=Svc1,ou=Novato,ou=California,dc=USA connects to RadiantOne, the custom size limit of 3 will be enforced.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nThis section is accessible only in <a href=\"01-introduction#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"granular-limits\">Granular Limits</h3>\n<p>To define custom limits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>ADD</strong> in the Custom Limits section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select a subject from the drop-down list. The possible subjects are described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sub-tree - the location (base DN) in the RadiantOne namespace containing the users that are affected by the custom limits.</li>\n<li>Group – a group entry in the virtual namespace. All members of this group are affected by the custom limits.</li>\n<li>Anonymous users – any authenticated users or anonymous users.</li>\n<li>Authenticated Users – any authenticated users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>CHOOSE</strong> to browse and select a subject location – if sub-tree is selected, the subject location is the base DN containing the users that are affected by the custom limits. If group is selected, the subject location is the DN of the group entry. All members of this group are affected by the custom limits. If authenticated users or anonymous users are selected, subject location is irrelevant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter a value for maximum connections. This is the maximum number of concurrent connections the subject can create. By default, this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on maximum connections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter a value for size limit. This is the maximum number of entries a search operation can return. This allows for limiting the number of entries LDAP clients can receive from a query. By default, this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on the size.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter a value for idle timeout. This is the length of time (in seconds) to keep a connection open without any activity from the client. By default, this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on idle time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The RadiantOne service needs to be restarted.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"number-of-processing-queues\">Number of Processing Queues</h3>\n<p>If you are running RadiantOne on a multi-processor machine, performance and efficiency of the server might improve by increasing the value for the Number of Processing Queues parameter. The default value is 2 and is sufficient for most deployments. As a general guideline, this value should never exceed 3.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] This parameter does not affect the actual number of processors that get used. However, it does improve the utilization of the available processors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A better indicator for performance is the number of threads allocated for each processing queue. For each processing queue, the maximum number of concurrent worker threads is 80 by default. This value can be seen/changed in the Max Concurrent Working Threads parameter. For more details, see the next section.</p>\n<p>After making changes, click <strong>Save</strong>. RadiantOne must be restarted for the changes to take effect. If deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximum-concurrent-working-threads\">Maximum Concurrent Working Threads</h3>\n<p>This is the number of threads the virtual directory server uses for handling client requests. In other words, this defines the number of concurrent LDAP requests RadiantOne can handle. If there are backends involved (e.g. proxy views without persistent cache), then you must also consider how the backend handles the level of concurrency you define here as well because requests made to RadiantOne may directly result in concurrent requests sent to the backend(s).</p>\n<p>The default value is 16, which means 16 worker threads allocated per processing queue defined in the Number of Processing Queues property. This amount is sufficient for most deployments and generally should not be modified unless recommended by Radiant Logic. You might be able to increase this number if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You are using a multiprocessor system - Multiprocessor systems can support larger thread pools than single processor systems. See the Number of Processors parameter above.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clients connecting to RadiantOne perform many time-consuming operations simultaneously (like complex searches or updates).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne needs to support many simultaneous client connections.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is difficult to provide an exact formula for determining the optimal number of maximum concurrent working threads to set because it depends on the machine and environment where RadiantOne is running. Generally, the value for concurrent working threads should not be modified unless recommended by Radiant Logic. If it is modified, you must verify the value you set with testing. Incrementally change the value and retest. In the test results, you should start to see performance peak and then a decrease. The peak in the curve should represent the optimal setting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"max-pending-connection-requests\">Max Pending Connection Requests</h3>\n<p>The max pending connection property represents a queue of server socket connections associated with requests from clients. This is not managed by the RadiantOne process. As soon as a TCP connection is established to RadiantOne, the connection is removed from the pending queue. A maximum number of pending client requests can be set in the Max Pending Connection Requests parameter. This parameter should not be changed unless advised by a Radiant Logic Support Engineer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"access-regulation\">Access Regulation</h2>\n<p>After a client connects to the RadiantOne service, the amount of activity they perform can be limited by configuring access regulation. The activity checking can be performed based on the user that connects to RadiantOne and/or what computer/client (IP address) they are connecting from.</p>\n<p>The “Restrictions Checking Interval” parameter indicated in the Per User or Per Computer sections is the time frame in which the activity (max binds and max operations) is monitored. Once the time interval is reached, the counts are reset. For example, if Special Users Group checking is enabled, and the checking interval, max bind operations per checking interval and max operations per checking interval are set to 300, 30 and 10 respectively, during a 5 minute (300 secs) period, anyone who is a member of the special users group can bind no more than 30 times to the RadiantOne service and not perform more than 10 operations. This count resets every 5 minutes. If a user attempts to perform more than the allowed number of operations, the RadiantOne service refuses the operation and the client must wait until the checking interval resets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"per-user\">Per User</h3>\n<p>The following groups of users found on the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Limits section > Per User sub-section allow you to configure fine-grained activity control:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nMembers of the Administrators group specified on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Server Front End > Administration section do not have any access limitations in terms of max connections or max operations per second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"anonymous\">Anonymous</h3>\n<p>An anonymous user is a client who connects anonymously (no username or password) to the RadiantOne service. To enable checking for this category of user, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Anonymous section of the Per User Category sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum bind operations that anonymous users are allowed to perform. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authenticated-users\">Authenticated Users</h3>\n<p>An authenticated user encompasses any client who successfully authenticates no matter which group they are a member of. To enable checking for this category of users, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Authenticated Users section of the Per User Category sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum bind operations that authenticated users are allowed to perform. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"special-users-group\">Special Users Group</h3>\n<p>Special Users are anyone who successfully binds and is a member of the special user group defined on the Main Control Panel > Server Front End > Administration section. To enable checking for this category of users, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Special Users Group section in the Per User Category sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum bind operations that users in the Special Users Group are allowed to perform. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"per-computerclient\">Per Computer/Client</h3>\n<p>Computers/client applications are identified by their IP address. IP configurations are located on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Limits Section > Per Computer sub-section. These settings allow you to configure fine-grained activity control per computer/client machines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ip-address\">IP address</h3>\n<p>All client machines fall into this category. To enable checking for this category of computer, check the Enable Access Checking option in the IP Address section of the Per Computer sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum amount of connections all computers are allowed to create. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"special-ip-address\">Special IP Address</h3>\n<p>Any client who connects from one of the IP addresses listed in the Special IP Addresses parameter.</p>\n<p>Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported, and you can indicate a range of IP addresses using “/”. A mix of IPv4 and IPv6 can also be used.</p>\n<p>Example set for a range of IPv4 addresses:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">10.11.12.0/24    which represents the given IPv4 address and its associated routing prefix 10.11.12.0, or equivalently, its subnet mask 255.255.255.0, which has 24 leading 1-bits. This covers the range between 10.11.12.0 to 10.11.12.255.</code></p>\n<p>Example set for a range of IPv6 addresses:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">2001:db8::/32    which covers the range between 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:0 to 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff</code></p>\n<p>To enable checking for this category of computer/client, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Special IP Address section on the Per Computer sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum amount of connections all computers are allowed to create. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf you have enabled activity checking for both users (special users, authenticated and/or anonymous) and computers (IP address and Special IP), the activity per computer takes precedence over the user activity. The order of precedence is special IP addresses, IP addresses, special users, authenticated users, and then anonymous users. For example, let’s say that special user access checking, IP address access checking, and special IP address access checking have been enabled, and the max connections are set to 50, 30, and 40 respectively. Any user who connects that is a member of the special users group from a computer that is not a member of the special IP address group, is only allowed to make a maximum of 30 connections during the checking interval.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">a-zA-Z0-9<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"security"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Security"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To access the RadiantOne service via LDAP, the LDAP client must authenticate itself.

If a user attempts to perform more than the allowed number of operations, the RadiantOne service refuses the operation and the client must wait until the checking interval resets."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"per-user"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Per User"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The following groups of users found on the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Limits section > Per User sub-section allow you to configure fine-grained activity control:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"blockquote","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"[!note]\r\nMembers of the Administrators group specified on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Server Front End > Administration section do not have any access limitations in terms of max connections or max operations per second."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"anonymous"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Anonymous"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"An anonymous user is a client who connects anonymously (no username or password) to the RadiantOne service.
