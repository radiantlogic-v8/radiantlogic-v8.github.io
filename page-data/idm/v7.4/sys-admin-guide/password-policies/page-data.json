For more details, see <a href=\"#password-policy-precedence\">Password Policy Precedence</a>. To enable password policy enforcement for a persistent cache branch, check the Enable Password Policy Enforcement option on the cache settings.

Enter a policy name applicable to the intended usage and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>\n<p>The ‘Subject’ of the custom policy can be either Sub-tree or Group and is based on a specific base DN. Click <strong>CHOOSE</strong> to select a base DN. If the subject is set to sub-tree, this means that all user entries below the chosen base DN (which must be a RadiantOne Universal Directory store or persistent cache) are affected by the custom policy. If the subject is set to group, this means that all users that are a member of the group specified in the base DN are affected by the custom policy. The group DN can represent a static group (unique members listed in the group entry) or a dynamic group (associated with the groupOfURLs object class and contains a memberURL attribute dictating the members). RadiantOne evaluates dynamic membership automatically to enforce password policies. If a user is affected by a policy defined for sub-tree and for group, the one associated with the group takes precedence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Custom policy properties override those defined in the default policy. The only exception is the password content properties where you can choose to enable the enforcement of the custom policy, or choose to use the default policy. Keep in mind that a value of 0 (zero) in a custom policy for password content means an unlimited amount is allowed. It does not mean that it is undefined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An example of a custom password policy is shown below. It is applicable to all users who are located in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store and are a member of the Special Users group identified in the DIT as cn=special users,ou=globalgroups,cn=config.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] If you define multiple custom password policies associated with groups (as the Subject), they should not have the same precedence if they share members. If a user is affected by multiple group-based policies, the one with the highest precedence (lowest numeric value in the precedence setting) is enforced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 32%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Example Custom Password Policy Applicable to a Group\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/b966c/Image3.104.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/c1cfe/Image3.104.jpg 275w,\n/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/67061/Image3.104.jpg 550w,\n/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/b966c/Image3.104.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 49: Example Custom Password Policy Applicable to a Group</p>\n<p>An example of a custom password policy applicable to all users below a specific container is shown below.

If not 0d, the value must be greater than or equal to the value of pwdMinAge (the Allow a password to be changed after a certain number of days parameter). From the Main Control Panel, you can indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). A value of 1d 5h 45m would indicate a password expires after 1 day, 5 hours and 45 minutes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Your password policy must uphold the following rule: pwdMinAge + pwdExpireWarning &#x3C; pwdMaxAge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If a user’s password is expired, the next time a client (on the user’s behalf) connects to RadiantOne, the bind will fail and the additional information returned to the client indicates the password has expired.

It contains the amount of time before a password is due to expire in which case an expiration warning message is returned to an authenticating user. From the Main Control Panel, you can indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). A value of 1d would indicate a password expiration warning should be sent 1 day prior to the password expiring.</p>\n<p>If this attribute is not present, or if the value is 0d no warnings are returned. If not 0d, the value must be smaller than the value of the pwdMaxAge attribute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Your password policy must uphold the following rule: pwdMinAge + pwdExpireWarning &#x3C; pwdMaxAge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When this is configured, a control is returned with the BindResponse (even if the client doesn’t specifically request it) indicating the amount of time until expiration.

If true, the user’s password must not contain the user’s accoutname or parts of the user’s full name that exceed two consecutive characters.</p>\n<p>For the accountname value, the sAMAccountname attribute is checked first. If sAMAccountname is not found, the uid attribute is checked. If uid is not found, rdn value is checked. For the user’s full name, the attribute displayName is checked. If displayName is not present, cn is checked. If the cn attribute is not found, the full name is computed (givenName+sn) and checked. These checks are not case-sensitive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"password-encryption\">Password Encryption</h3>\n<p>The passwords that are stored in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store may be hashed using any of the following methods: Clear, CRYPT, MD5, PBKDF2AD, Salted SHA-1, Salted SHA-256, Salted SHA-384, Salted SHA-512, and SHA-1. The least secure methods of CRYPT, MD5, and SHA-1 have been hidden as options from the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] PBKDF2AD is the required password encryption expected in Azure AD. Therefore, if your HDAP store (or persistent cache) will be synchronized to Azure AD, and passwords are a part of the synchronization, use the PBKDF2AD encryption option to store passwords in the RadiantOne Universal Directory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"automatic-update-to-stronger-password-hash\">Automatic Update to Stronger Password Hash</h3>\n<p>If the “Update stored passwords to stronger encryption after successful bind” is enabled, user accounts that contain a password hashed with a less secure method than allowed for the current password policy are automatically updated to the stronger hash after a successful bind. The only exception to this is for passwords that have a current hash of: PKCS5S2, PBKDF2, PBKDF2AD, SCRYPT, BCRYPT, SMD4, or MD4, in which case the hashing is not changed. This value is stored in the pwdEnableAlgorithmUpgrade attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and has a value of True or False.</p>\n<p>The strength order is as follows:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">CLEAR -> CRYPT -> MD5 -> SHA1 -> SSHA1 -> SHA256 -> SSHA256 -> SHA384 -> SSHA384 -> SHA512 -> SSHA512 -> (PKCS5S2 | PBKDF2 | PBKDF2AD | SCRYPT | BCRYPT | SMD4 | MD4)</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] PKCS5S2, PBKDF2, PBKDF2AD, SCRYPT, BCRYPT, SMD4, and MD4 are considered as special hashes of the strongest ranking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"password-strength-rule\">Password Strength Rule</h3>\n<p>The default options for enforcing password content are based on an AND operation. For example, if you set a minimum password length, minimum number of required digits, and a minimum number of required uppercase letters, the rule would be expressed as follows.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;min password length> AND &lt;min # of digits> AND &lt;min # uppercase letters>.</code></p>\n<p>The Password Strength Rule option allows you to define and test password strength requirements that are more complex using an OR condition. For example, you could use the Password Strength Rule option to require a password to have 'n' number of special characters OR 'n' number of Upper Case characters. In another example, a password strength rule requiring at least six total characters, with at least one lower case, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit OR one symbol would be expressed in the Password Strength Rule field as follows.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">^.(?=.{6,})(?=.[a-z])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[\\d\\W]).*$</code></p>\n<p>Another example would be if you do not want to allow special characters to be used in the password. This would be expressed in the Password Strength Rule field as:\n<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>+$</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Checking the Password Strength Rule box disables and overrides all other password Content options except Password minimum length and Password encryption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Enter your password strength rule using regular expression syntax.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Test</strong> to compile your expression.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-dictionary-check\">Enable Dictionary Check</h3>\n<p>The Enable Dictionary Check option is comparable to the Strong Password Check plug-in found in legacy LDAP directories. This enables RadiantOne to verify that a user’s password doesn’t contain unallowed strings from a specified dictionary file. This can be used as a method to enforce strong password policies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] The default behavior uses an exact match comparison of the password to a dictionary value. To enforce a contains match comparison, go to the Main Control Panel > Zookeeper tab, navigate to <code class=\"language-text\">/radiantone/&lt;version>/&lt;clusterName>/config/vds_server.conf</code> and click EDIT MODE. Set the following: \"enablePwdPolicyDictionarySubstringCheck\" : true <BR> The value of “true” must be in all lowercase, as shown above. <BR>You can also set this property using the vdsconfig command line utility, set-property command. For details, see the <a href=\"/command-line-configuration-guide/01-introduction\">Radiantone Command Line Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To enable this feature:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From Main Control Panel, navigate to the Settings tab >Security > Password policies section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Locate the Password Content section and check the option to Enable Dictionary Check. This value is stored in the pwdEnableDictionary attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and has a value of True or False.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Browse</strong> to navigate to the dictionary file. The value for the location of the dictionary file is stored in the pwdDictionaryFile attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The dictionary file must be a text-formatted file containing one dictionary word per line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"account-activity-and-lockout\">Account Activity and Lockout</h2>\n<p>Accounts may be automatically locked under two circumstances:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If a user has not authenticated successfully to RadiantOne for longer than a specified period of time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a user has reached the failed login threshold.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"keep-track-of-users-last-successful-login-time\">Keep Track of User’s Last Successful Login Time</h3>\n<p>If you want to keep track of a user’s last successful login time, enable the option to “Keep track of the user’s last successful logon time” in the Account Activity section of the password policy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] You can exclude pwdLastLogonTime changes from the RadiantOne changelog by setting the following property in ZooKeeper at /radiantone/&#x3C;Config_Version>/&#x3C;RadiantOne_ClusterName>/config/vds_server.conf: \"skipLoggingIntoChangelogForPwdLastLogonTime\" : \"true\", <BR> This alleviates excessive writing into the changelog when you have a large volume of user login activity. This property is enforced globally and affects all password policies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can indicate the frequency that RadiantOne records the time of the last successful authentication. The default value is 0s meaning that the last login time is updated on every successful authentication. To change the default, indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). For example, a value of 1d indicates the last login time is updated if at least 1 day has passed since the last successful authentication. Subsequent successful authentications, within this time frame, do not change the last login time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] There is a performance impact on RadiantOne if you keep track of last successful logins because a write operation is performed with a successful bind. It is recommended that you indicate a frequency for writing the last login and that you test the usage of this feature to determine if the degradation in performance is acceptable for your usage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If accounts should be automatically locked when a user has not authenticated successfully for a predetermined amount of time, indicate the threshold (number of days) in the “Account Activity” section of the password policy where you see “Lock user’s account if the user is idle longer than <X> days”. The user’s password must be reset to unlock the account. Once the account is unlocked, if it is not used for login longer than the specified time, the account is locked again. If the value is zero days, this means users will never be locked out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lock-accounts-based-on-number-of-failed-logins\">Lock Accounts Based on Number of Failed Logins</h3>\n<p>If accounts should be locked out after a failed login threshold is met, check the Accounts may be locked out option in the password policy, and establish the criteria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How may login failures are allowed? Enter this value for X (Lockout account after X login failures).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdMaxFailure attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and contains the number of failed login attempts to allow. This corresponds to the operational attribute for the user entry named pwdFailureTime which stores the time(s) of the login failure(s).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How often to reset the failure count? Enter this value for X (Reset failure count after X minutes).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdFailureCountInterval attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. This is the temporary interval of time in which RadiantOne keeps track of the number of failed login attempts. For example, if the number of login failures allowed is 2 and the reset failure account is 5 minutes, this means if a user login fails twice within 5 minutes, the account will be locked. If the user logs in unsuccessfully once and then doesn’t try again until after the 5-minute interval has passed, the number of unsuccessful login attempts is reset and the new failed login attempt counts as the first failure instead of the second failure. This relates to the number of values for the pwdFailureTime operational attribute in the user’s entry which is used to determine how many failed logins have been attempted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Once an account is locked, the reset failure count is irrelevant in terms of determining how many failed login attempts have occurred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How long is an account locked out?\n<br>Lockout forever\n<br>Lockout duration X minutes</p>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdLockoutDuration attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. This relates to the operational attribute <a href=\"#pwdaccountlockedtime\">pwdAccountLockedTime</a> in the user’s entry which includes a timestamp indicating when the user’s account became locked. Once a lockout duration has passed, or a user’s password has been reset by an administrator, the account is unlocked. Any user (other than the locked out user) that has the proper permissions (ACI’s) can reset the user’s password.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"unlocking-accounts\">Unlocking Accounts</h3>\n<p>If a user’s account is locked, it can become unlocked by resetting the user’s password. Any user (other than the locked out user) that has the proper permissions (ACI’s) can reset the user’s password.

If the value matches a policy defined in RadiantOne, this policy is enforced for the user.

Only when a user’s password is set/reset by other users (e.g. helpdesk) is the pwdReset set to TRUE. When the affected user logs in with the new password for the first time, they are not allowed to perform operations until they reset their password.
