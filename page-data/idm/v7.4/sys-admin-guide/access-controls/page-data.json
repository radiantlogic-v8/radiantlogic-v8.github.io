It provides assurance that the entity claiming a particular identity, is the entity to which that identity was assigned. There are 5 levels of assurance used by RadiantOne to enforce access controls to data. The default level is no enforcement of assurance (Level 0). You can use this level when there is minimum risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.</p>\n<p>Level 1 indicates an authentication method of basic credentials (username+password) is required to access the data. At this level, there is little confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is low risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.</p>\n<p>Level 2 indicates an authentication method of Kerberos (leveraging GSSAPI) is required to access the data. At this level, there is some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is moderate risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nEnsure you have RadiantOne configured properly as a <a href=\"06-security#kerberos\">Kerberos LDAP service</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Level 3 indicates multi-factor authentication (e.g. RSA SecurID token code, Yubikey) is required to access the data. At this level, there is high confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is high risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nEnsure you have RadiantOne configured properly with a <a href=\"interception#custom-authentication-providers\">Custom Authentication Provider</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Level 4 indicates certificate-based (mutual) authentication is required to access the data. There is very high confidence in an asserted identity of the entity. This is the highest level of authentication assurance and should be used when there is very high risk associated with accessing the data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nEnsure you have RadiantOne configured properly for <a href=\"server-backend#mutual-authentication\">Mutual Authentication</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Select the assurance level from the drop-down list and select an operator.

You can allow or deny all operations, or you can assign one or more of the following:</p>\n<p><strong>All</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates that the subject has the following rights to the targeted entry: read, write, search, delete, compare, and selfwrite. The All access right does not give the following rights to the target entry: proxy.</p>\n<p>Example of syntax when all operations are selected:</p>\n<p>(targetattr = \"homePhone\")(target = \"ldap:///dv=address book,o=vds\")(targetfilter = \"(securitylevel=secret)\")(targetscope = \"subtree\")(version 3.0;acl \"myaci\";allow (all) (userdn = \"ldap:///all\");)</p>\n<p><strong>Read</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can read the directory entries and the attributes of entries specified in the ACI. This permission applies only to the search operation.</p>\n<p><strong>Search</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can search on the targets specified in the ACI. This permission applies only to the search operation. The Search right is checked once, and after the search is allowed or denied, it is not checked again. If the search is allowed, the read right is then applied to each entry to be returned as a result of the search and to each attribute of each entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Add</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can create entries.</p>\n<p><strong>Delete</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can delete entries.</p>\n<p><strong>Compare</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can compare data they supply in the request with data stored in the directory. With compare rights, the directory returns a success or failure message in response to an inquiry, but the user cannot see the value of the entry or attribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Write</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can modify an entry by adding, modifying, or deleting attributes. This permission applies to the modify and modRDN operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Self Write</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can add or delete their own DN in an attribute of the target group entry. The syntax of this attribute must be a distinguished name. This right is used only for group management. Self write works with proxy authorization: it grants the right to add or delete the proxy DN from the group entry (not the DN of the user from the Bind operation).</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy</strong></p>\n<p>Authorization for RadiantOne data is checked based on the user who authenticated. The authorization ID (DN) is linked to the authenticated ID (DN) for the same connection. With the proxy authorization control enabled, the client can switch the user ID (for authorization purposes) without having to re-authenticate with a new connection.</p>\n<p>If there is the need to base authorization on a different user than the one who authenticated, you can use the proxy authorization control. This is primarily useful in environments where an application must authenticate many users and doesn’t want to maintain an open connection to RadiantOne for each of them. With this approach, the application can authenticate the user, and after, impersonate that user for authorization purposes. The application can use its own service account when connecting to RadiantOne and pass the needed control along with the user DN of the person they want to represent for authorization in their requests. RadiantOne then checks the proxy authorization rules that have been configured in access controls to make sure the service account is allowed to represent the person passed in their request. If so, the service account is allowed to perform any operations the person they are impersonating would be allowed to do.</p>\n<p>The proxy option indicates whether the subject can access the target with the rights of another entry. You can grant proxy access using the DN of any user in the directory except the special cn=directory manager user. In addition, you cannot grant proxy rights to the cn=directory manager user. If the branch you are protecting with access controls is a local LDAP/HDAP store, then this requires the <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#proxied-authorization-control\">Proxy Authorization control</a> enabled for RadiantOne.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subjects\">Subjects</h3>\n<p>A subject is whom the access control rule applies to. The subject types that can be associated with access control rules are described below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] It is recommended to define access controls on subjects that are located in a RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) store or persistent cache. This prevents possible performance or network issues involved with RadiantOne connecting to a backend directory in order to enforce authorization. If your ACI’s require subjects that are located in backend directories, make sure that the backend is configured for high availability and that the <a href=\"concepts#data-source\">RadiantOne data source</a> is configured with the failover servers appropriately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Users – applicable to any specific user(s).</li>\n<li>Groups – applicable to a group of users. If the group is a nested group in HDAP, enable Main Control Panel > Settings > Security > Access Control > <a href=\"access-control#enable-nested-groups\">Enable Nested Groups</a> and configure <a href=\"interception#linked-attributes\">Linked Attribute</a> settings from Main Control Panel > Settings > Interception > Special Attributes Handling.</li>\n<li>Tree Branch - Applicable to the DN specified as part of the subject and all entries below it in the virtual directory tree. The defined access permissions apply to any user found in the tree branch you choose.</li>\n<li>Public – anyone connected to the directory is considered public. This also includes anonymous users.</li>\n<li>Self – applicable to the user whose authenticated DN matches the DN of the entry that is being accessed.</li>\n<li>Authenticated – applicable to any user who successfully authenticates.</li>\n<li>Group Owner - applicable to the owner, manager, or role of the group.  You can define the target, scope, attributes and permissions using the Control Panel and then select this ACI and click <strong>Manual Edit</strong> to refine the subject for this complex scenario. See below for an example:<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>(targetattr=\"*\")(target=\"ldap:///o=My Company?manager,owner,role\")(targetscope = \"subtree\")(version 3.0;acl \"Group owner access only\";allow (all)(userdn = \"ldap:///self\");)<br></p>\n<p>The above ACI will dictate that:  if the binding user is the \"manager\", or the \"owner\", or bearing the \"role\" of the targeted entity, then the binding user has the access to targeted entry;  otherwise, the access is denied.<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parent – applicable to the entry only if their bind DN is the parent of the targeted entry. For example, to allow users to modify any child entries of their bind DN, create the following ACI on the dv=address book,o=vds node:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(targetattr = \"*\")(target = \"ldap:///dv=address book,o=vds\")(targetscope = \"subtree\")(version 3.0;acl \"myaci\";allow (write) (userdn = \"ldap:///parent\");)<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP Address – applicable to a specific client IP address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can indicate that a client connection must originate from a single IP address or a range of addresses. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported and you can indicate a range of IP addresses using “/”. A mix of IPv4 and IPv6 can also be used. See below for examples:</p>\n<p><strong>Single IPv4 address</strong>\n<br>10.11.12.129</p>\n<p><strong>Single IPv6 address</strong>\n<br>fe80::b010:e554:f9d5:dec0%10\n<strong>Range of IPv4 addresses (use the “/”) like:</strong>\n<br>10.11.12.0/24 which represents the given IPv4 address and its associated routing prefix 10.11.12.0, or equivalently, its subnet mask 255.255.255.0, which has 24 leading 1-bits. This covers the range between 10.11.12.0 to 10.11.12.255.\n<strong>Range of IPv6 addresses:</strong>\n<br>2001:db8::/32    which covers the range between 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:0 to 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff</p>\n<p>For IPv6 addresses, use the syntax defined by RFC 2373. For example, 0:0:0:0:0:0:13.1.68.3 which can also be expressed as ::13.1.68.3 are both valid forms of IPv6 addresses. An address with a subnet prefix length can also be used (e.g. 12AB::CD30:0:0:0:0/60). Wildcards cannot be used in IPv6 addresses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\nTo use DNS addresses, manually edit the ACI after saving it by clicking <strong>Manually Edit</strong>. Use the keyword dns and enter the fully qualified DNS domain name. Use an operator of either “equal to” (=) or “not equal to” (!=). Wildcards are supported in the DNS address.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"aci-evaluation-rules\">ACI Evaluation Rules</h2>\n<p>The ACI evaluation rules that RadiantOne follows are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When the RadiantOne service starts, all ACIs defined in the entries below \"ou=aggregate,ou=globalaci,cn=config\" are loaded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To determine if an operation is allowed or denied, RadiantOne looks in the ACI list for the target of the operation to collect all target-matched aci values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne separates the aci values into two lists; one list contains all the aci values that match the target and denies the required access, and the other list contains all the aci values that match the target and allows the required access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the deny list contains any aci values after this procedure, access is immediately denied.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the deny list is empty, then the allow list is processed. If the allow list contains any aci values, access is allowed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If both lists are empty, access is denied.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nTo troubleshoot/trace ACI evaluation decisions, <a href=\"logs#log-settings\">RadiantOne server log level</a> must be set to DEBUG. When DEBUG level is set, the evaluation rules can be seen in: &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/logs/vds_server.log</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"setting-access-controls\">Setting Access Controls</h2>\n<p>To define access controls:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nAccess rights can be defined by any user who is a member of the ACI Administrators group or the Directory Administrators group. For details on all administrative groups available for RadiantOne, please see <a href=\"01-introduction#delegated-administration-of-radiantone\">Delegated Administration of RadiantOne</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Access Control sub-section, select the Enable ACI checkbox on the right side in the Authorization section and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Access Control section, select root.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Although there is not an absolute requirement, it is generally recommended to define all your access controls at the root level so you can come back to this single level and see all configured access controls across the entire virtual namespace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Add</strong>. The Edit ACI pane is displayed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The Target Scope pull-down menu value defaults to subtree, and the Target Attributes value defaults to All.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter an ACI description.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Choose</strong> to navigate to the target DN.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Target Scope drop-down list, select base, onelevel or subtree.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Target Filter, enter an applicable LDAP filter to narrow the entries affected by the access control rule. This step is optional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the Target Attributes, select either “equal to” (=) or “not equal to” (!=) from the drop-down list. Then choose to either have the access rule apply to “all” or “custom”. If custom is selected, click SELECT to narrow the list.</p>\n<p>If you choose custom, and your attribute doesn’t appear in the list, you must update the RadiantOne LDAP schema appropriately before setting the ACI. For details on this, please see <a href=\"radiantone-ldap-schema#extending-the-radiantone-ldap-schema\">Extending RadiantOne LDAP Schema</a>. After the schema has been updated, go back to the Settings tab > Security section > Access Controls sub-section and follow the steps mentioned above to add the custom attribute list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Permissions section, select either to allow or deny.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the <a href=\"06-security#operations\">operations</a> that you want allowed or denied.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Authentication Context section, configure bind rules as needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Apply to section, select the <a href=\"06-security#subjects\">subjects</a> that will be allowed or denied access.</p>\n<p>To assign users, groups or users associated in a specific tree/branch, click <strong>LDAP SEARCH</strong>.</p>\n<p>To assign public, click <strong>ALLOW PUBLIC</strong>.</p>\n<p>To assign self, click <strong>ALLOW SELF</strong>.</p>\n<p>To assign specific IP addresses, click <strong>ALLOW IP</strong>.</p>\n<p>To assign all authenticated users, click <strong>ALLOW AUTHENTICATED</strong>.</p>\n<p>To assign permissions associated with the parent, click <strong>ALLOW PARENT</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong> when finished.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"global-authorization-settings\">Global Authorization Settings</h2>\n<p>The settings configured in the Authorization section determine how RadiantOne handles authorization. These settings dictate whether RadiantOne enforces defined access controls, allows anonymous access, requires passwords for bind operations, and if nested groups are supported. Each setting is described in more details below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-aci\">Enable ACI</h3>\n<p>The checking of ACIs by RadiantOne can be enabled or disabled by using the Enable ACI checkbox. Check the box to enable and uncheck to disable. For specific details about setting ACI, please see <a href=\"#security-and-access-controls\">Security and Access Controls</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-anonymous-access\">Allow Anonymous Access</h3>\n<p>If RadiantOne should allow anonymous access, then check the Allow Anonymous Access checkbox. If RadiantOne should not allow anonymous access, make sure this checkbox is not checked. This is the default global access permission for anonymous users and is enforced before subsequent ACI rules. In other words, even if anonymous access were allowed as a general policy, subsequent ACI rules could prevent anonymous users from accessing any data. For details on access controls that can be set, please <a href=\"#security-and-access-controls\">Security and Access Controls</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-directory-manager-to-impersonate-other-users\">Allow Directory Manager to Impersonate Other Users</h3>\n<p>Proxy authorization allows the user that creates a connection to RadiantOne to impersonate/request access on behalf of another user. This allows authorization to be enforced for a user other than the one that creates the connection/binds to RadiantOne. By default, the RadiantOne super user (e.g. cn=directory manager) is not allowed to impersonate other users. If you want this special user to be able to impersonate other users (to enforce authorization based on other users instead of as the super user), enable the “Allow Directory Manager to Impersonate Other Users” option. Also, verify that the <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#proxied-authorization-control\">Proxy Authorization Control</a> is enabled for RadiantOne because this is the control that allows clients to request access on behalf of another user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bind-requires-ssl-or-starttls\">Bind Requires SSL or StartTLS</h3>\n<p>If a user binds to RadiantOne and provides a password, that password is vulnerable to interception by a third party when sent over non-SSL ports. To help prevent this vulnerability, you can enforce that binds always use the SSL/TLS ports by using the Bind requires SSL or StartTLS option.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] As a best practice, it is recommended that you only allow SSL communication to the RadiantOne service. If you require non-SSL communication but still want to require that binds use SSL or StartTLS, you can use this option.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This option requires enabling SSL.

This may introduce security problems for the client application, or in certain cases where machines like printers may bind against RadiantOne, that do not verify that the client actually provided a password. If the Bind Requires Password setting is enabled, and no password is specified in the bind request, RadiantOne tries to bind the specified user and return an invalid credential error to the client. If Bind Requires Password is not enabled, and a bind request comes in with a valid user DN and no password, it is considered an anonymous bind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-nested-groups\">Enable Nested Groups</h3>\n<p>If you have groups stored in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store and want to support groups as members, check the Enable Nested Groups option.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] Processing nested groups is not efficient and is not enabled by default. When nested groups are used in RadiantOne ACLs for access controls, many recursive searches are required. Large groups with a mix of many members including other groups as members can have poor performance. Use nested groups with caution and validate your use case with performance testing to ensure response times meet your needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"ldap_matching_rule_in_chain\">LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne supports the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN operator and allows clients to issue search filters using the 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941 matching rule OID. This provides a method to look up the ancestry of an object and can be used in a search filter to retrieve all groups a user is a member of even when that group is nested (and is a member of another group). If the base DN in the RadiantOne namespace is associated with a proxy view, the search filter containing the matching rule OID is passed to the backend which must process the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN. If the base DN in the RadiantOne namespace is associated with a persistent cache or a Universal Directory store, RadiantOne processes the matching rule locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] If you are using the Linked Attributes calculation in RadiantOne and the users and groups are local, in a persistent cache or Universal Directory store, you must enable the Optimize Linked Attribute setting to support filters requesting isMemberOf/memberOf. This ensures good performance. For details on this setting, see the Namespace Configuration Guide (applicable to RadiantOne Universal Directory stores) or the <a href=\"/deployment-and-tuning-guide/00-preface\">RadiantOne Deployment and Tuning Guide</a> (applicable to persistent cache).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 237px; display:inline-block; width: 237px; pointer-events:none; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 12.658227848101264%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAADABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAdkM1BX/xAAXEAADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREx/9oACAEBAAEFAqysWf/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABQQAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQEABj8Cf//EABgQAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhATFh/9oACAEBAAE/IUWaDxP/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEAQP/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPxA//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPxA//8QAGRABAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARMSFR/9oACAEBAAE/EG73sfbkahbWf//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/be46ae4f38b4ab6e9a25650017c3a1f6/8fe27/Image3.112.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/be46ae4f38b4ab6e9a25650017c3a1f6/8fe27/Image3.112.jpg 237w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>As a simple example, assume there is a group named All Users and that this group is a member of another group named Sales.
