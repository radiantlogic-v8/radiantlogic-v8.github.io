With persistent cache, the RadiantOne service can offer a guaranteed level of performance because the underlying data source(s) do not need to be queried and once the server starts, the cache is ready without having to “prime” with an initial set of queries. Also, you do not need to worry about how quickly the underlying data source can respond. What is unique about the persistent cache is if the RadiantOne service receives an update for information that is stored in the cache, the underlying data source(s) receives the update, and the persistent cache is refreshed automatically. In addition, you have the option of configuring real-time cache refreshes which automatically update the persistent cache image when data changes directly on the backend sources. For more details, please see <a href=\"#options-for-refreshing-the-persistent-cache\">Refreshing the Persistent Cache</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nIf you plan on caching (either entry memory cache or persistent cache) the branch in the tree that maps to an LDAP backend, you must list the operational attributes you want to be in the cache as “always requested”. Otherwise, the entry stored in cache would not have these attributes and clients accessing these entries may need them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"persistent-cache-disk-space-requirements\">Persistent Cache Disk Space Requirements</h2>\n<p>Initialization of a persistent cache happens in two phases. The first phase is to create an LDIF formatted file of the cache contents (if you already have an LDIF file, you have the option to use this existing file as opposed to generating a new one). The second phase is to initialize the cache with the LDIF file. After the first phase, RadiantOne prepares the LDIF file to initialize the cache. Therefore, you need to consider at least these two LDIF files and the amount of disk space to store the entries in cache.</p>\n<p>Best practice would be to take four times the size of the LDIF file generated to determine the disk space that is required to initialize the persistent cache. For example, lab tests have shown 50 million entries (1KB or less in size) generates an LDIF file approximately 50 GB in size. So total disk space recommended to create the persistent cache for this example would be 200 GB.</p>\n<h2 id=\"initializing-persistent-cache\">Initializing Persistent Cache</h2>\n<p>Persistent cache should be initialized during off-peak hours, or during scheduled downtime, since it is a CPU-intensive process and during the initialization queries are delegated to the backend data sources which might not be able to handle the load.</p>\n<p>When initializing persistent cache, two settings you should take into consideration are paging and initializing cache from an encrypted file. These options are described in this section.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nIf you are using real-time refresh, make sure the cache refresh components are stopped before re-initializing or re-indexing a persistent cache.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"using-paging\">Using Paging</h3>\n<p>Depending on the complexity of the virtual view, building the persistent cache image can take some time. Since the internal connections used by RadiantOne to build the persistent cache image are subject to the Idle Connection Timeout server setting, the cache initialization process might fail due to the connection being automatically closed by the server. To avoid cache initialization problems, it is recommended to use paging for internal connections. To use paging:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Server Front End > Supported Controls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the right, check the option to Enable Paged Results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Server Backend > Internal Connections (requires <a href=\"00-preface#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the right, check the option for Paged Results Control, page size: 1000.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"supporting-zipped-and-encrypted-ldif-files\">Supporting Zipped and Encrypted LDIF Files</h3>\n<p>If you are initializing persistent cache using an existing LDIFZ file, the security key used in RadiantOne (for attribute encryption) where the file was exported must be the same security key value used on the RadiantOne server that you are trying to import the file into.</p>\n<p>If you are creating a new LDIF file to initialize the persistent cache, you have the option to use an LDIFZ file which is a zipped and encrypted file format. This ensures that the data to be cached is not stored in clear in files required for the initialization process.</p>\n<p>To use this option, you must have an LDIFZ encryption key configured. The security key is defined from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security > Attribute Encryption section.</p>\n<p>Once the security key has been defined, check the option to “Use .ldifz (zipped and secure format).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 301px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 59.63636363636364%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAMABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDAgX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB7beEoTF//8QAGBAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECIDH/2gAIAQEAAQUCpLEf/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPwE//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAFBABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAQAGPwJf/8QAGRABAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIRCR/9oACAEBAAE/IZTPONLmM0bP/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABDMD//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEBEP/aAAgBAwEBPxCjn//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEBEP/aAAgBAgEBPxCJn//EABwQAQACAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESFRkTFxof/aAAgBAQABPxCm/B2C02dnv6lGjkZrkM0RqNFvRP/Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/34e60315b412b44588ddc21ab52c6998/50ff8/Image2.4.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/34e60315b412b44588ddc21ab52c6998/c1cfe/Image2.4.jpg 275w,\n/static/34e60315b412b44588ddc21ab52c6998/50ff8/Image2.4.jpg 301w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.4: Using LDIFZ File to Initialize Persistent Cache</p>\n<h2 id=\"options-for-refreshing-the-persistent-cache\">Options for Refreshing the Persistent Cache</h2>\n<p>There are four categories of events that can invoke a persistent cache refresh.

Agents can run on any type of RadiantOne cluster node (follower or leaders) and there is only one agent running at any given time in a RadiantOne cluster. The agent doesn't consume a lot of memory, and they are not CPU-intensive, so there is no point in running multiple processes to distribute connectors on multiple nodes. One agent is enough per cluster and makes things simpler.</p>\n<p>This type of refresh is described as “Real-time” in the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace > Cache settings > Cache Branch > Refresh Settings tab (on the right). This is the recommended approach if a real-time refresh is needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"periodic-refresh\">Periodic Refresh</h3>\n<p>In certain cases, if you know the data in the backends does not change frequently (e.g. once a day), you may not care about refreshing the persistent cache immediately when a change is detected in the underlying data source. In this case, a periodic refresh can be used.</p>\n<p>If you have built your view in either the Context Builder tab or Directory Namespace Tab, you can define the refresh interval after you’ve configured the persistent cache. The option to enable periodic refresh is on the Refresh Settings tab (on the right) for the selected persistent cache node.

Each is described below.</p>\n<p><em>Create an LDIF from a Snapshot</em></p>\n<p>If this is the first time you’ve initialized the persistent cache, then you should choose this option. An LDIF formatted file is generated from the virtual view and then imported into the local RadiantOne Universal Directory store.</p>\n<p><em>Initialize from an Existing LDIF File</em></p>\n<p>If you’ve initialized the persistent cache before and the LDIF file was created successfully from the backend source(s) (and the data from the backend(s) has not changed since the generation of the LDIF file), then you can choose to use that existing file. The persisting of the cache occurs in two phases. The first phase generates an LDIF file with the data returned from the queries to the underlying data source(s). The second phase imports the LDIF file into the local RadiantOne Universal Directory store. If there is a failure during the second phase, and you must re-initialize the persistent cache, you have the option to choose the LDIF file (that was already built during the first phase) instead of having to re-generate it (as long as the LDIF file generated successfully). You can click browse and navigate to the location of the LDIF. The LDIF files generated are in &#x3C;RLI_HOME>&#x3C;instance_name>\\ldif\\import.</p>\n<p>If you have a large data set and generated multiple LDIF files for the purpose of initializing the persistent cache (each containing a subset of what you want to cache), name the files with a suffix of “_2”, “_3”…etc. For example, let’s say the initial LDIF file (containing the first subset of data you want to import) is named cacheinit.ldif. After this file has been imported, the process attempts to find cacheinit_2.ldif, then cacheinit_3.ldif…etc. Make sure all files are located in the same place so the initialization process can find them.</p>\n<p>After you choose to either generate or re-use an LDIF file, click Finish and cache initialization begins. Cache initialization is launched as a task and can be viewed and managed from the Tasks Tab in the Server Control Panel associated with the RadiantOne leader node. Therefore, you do not need to wait for the initialization to finish before exiting the initialization window.</p>\n<p>After the persistent cache is initialized, queries are handled locally by the RadiantOne service and no longer be sent to the backend data source(s). For information about properties associated with persistent cache, please see <a href=\"#persistent-cache-properties\">Persistent Cache Properties</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"periodic-refresh-cron-expression\">Periodic Refresh CRON Expression</h3>\n<p>If periodic refresh is enabled, you must define the refresh interval in this property.

This type of caching option leverages the RadiantOne Universal Directory storage for the cache image.</p>\n<p>If you choose a real-time refresh strategy, there are two terms you need to become familiar with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cache Dependency – cache dependencies are all objects/views related to the view that is configured for persistent cache. A cache dependency is used by the cache refresh process to understand all the different objects/views that need to be updated based on changes to the backend sources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cache Refresh Topology – a cache refresh topology is a graphical representation of the flow of data needed to refresh the cache. The topology includes an object/icon that represents the source (the backend object where changes are detected from), the queue (the temporary storage of the message), and the cache destination.

Please see the section titled <a href=\"#configuring-source-connectors\">Configuring Source Connectors</a> for steps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Refresh Settings tab, click Initialize to initialize the persistent cache.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are two options for initializing a persistent cache. Each is described below.</p>\n<p><em>Create an LDIF File</em></p>\n<p>If this is the first time you’ve initialized the persistent cache, choose this option. An LDIF formatted file is generated from the virtual view and then imported into the cache.</p>\n<p><em>Using an Existing LDIF</em></p>\n<p>If you’ve initialized the persistent cache before and the LDIF file was created successfully from the backend source(s) (and the data from the backend(s) has not changed since the generation of the LDIF file), then you can choose this option to use that existing file. The persisting of the cache occurs in two phases. The first phase generates an LDIF file with the data returned from the queries to the underlying data source(s). The second phase imports the LDIF file into the local RadiantOne Universal Directory store. If there is a failure during the second phase, and you must re-initialize the persistent cache, you have the option to choose the LDIF file (that was already built during the first phase) instead of having to re-generate it (as long as the LDIF file generated successfully). You can click browse and navigate to the location of the LDIF. The LDIF files generated are in <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;RLI_HOME>\\&lt;vds_server>\\ldif\\import</code>.</p>\n<p>If you have a large data set and generated multiple LDIF files for the purpose of initializing the persistent cache (each containing a subset of what you want to cache), name the files with a suffix of “_2”, “_3”…etc. For example, let’s say the initial LDIF file (containing the first subset of data you want to import) is named cacheinit.ldif. After this file has been imported, the process attempts to find cacheinit_2.ldif, then cacheinit_3.ldif…etc. Make sure all files are located in the same place so the initialization process can find them.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The cache initialization process begins. The cache initialization is performed as a task and can be viewed and managed from the Tasks Tab in the Server Control Panel associated with the RadiantOne leader node. Therefore, you do not need to wait for the initialization to finish before exiting the initialization window.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The view(s) is now in the persistent cache. Queries are handled locally by RadiantOne and are no longer sent to the backend data source(s). Real-time cache refresh has been configured. For information about properties associated with persistent cache, please see <a href=\"#persistent-cache-properties\">Persistent Cache Properties</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"configuring-source-connectors-overview\">Configuring Source Connectors Overview</h3>\n<p>Configuring connectors involves deciding how you want to detect changes from your backend(s). By default, all <a href=\"#directory-connectors\">directory connectors</a> and <a href=\"#custom-connectors\">custom connectors</a> (only custom connectors included in the RadiantOne install) are configured and started immediately without further configuration. For databases, configure the connector to use the desired change detection mechanism.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nAll connectors leverage the connection pooling settings defined from the Main Control Panel > Settings tab. In other words, the connector opens a connection to the data source to pick up changes and keeps the connection open so when the next interval passes a new connection does not need to be created.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"configuring-source-database-connectors\">Configuring Source Database Connectors</h3>\n<p>For database backends (JDBC-accessible), the change detection options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#db-changelog\">Changelog</a> – This connector type relies on a database table that contains all changes that have occurred on the base tables (that the RadiantOne virtual view is built from). This typically involves having triggers on the base tables that write into the log/changelog table. However, an external process may be used instead of triggers. The connector picks up changes from the changelog table based on a specified interval which is 10 seconds by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#db-timestamp\">Timestamp</a> – This connector type has been validated against Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Apache Derby. The database table must have a primary key defined for it and an indexed column that contains a timestamp/date value. This value must be maintained and modified accordingly for each record that is updated.</p>\n<p>For Oracle databases, the timestamp column type must be one of the following: \"TIMESTAMP\", \"DATE\", \"TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE\", \"TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE\".</p>\n<p>For SQL Server database, the timestamp column type must be one of the following: \"SMALLDATETIME\", \"DATETIME\", \"DATETIME2\"</p>\n<p>For MYSQL or MariaDB databases, the timestamp column type must be one of the following: \"TIMESTAMP\", \"DATETIME\"</p>\n<p>For PostgreSQL databases, the timestamp column type must be one of the following: \"TIMESTAMP\", \"timestamp without time zone” (equivalent to timestamp), “TIMESTAMPTZ”, “timestamp with time zone” (equivalent to timestamptz)</p>\n<p>For Derby databases, the timestamp column type must be: \"TIMESTAMP\"</p>\n<p>The DB Timestamp connector leverages the timestamp column to determine which records have changed since the last polling interval. This connector type does not detect delete operations. If you have a need to detect and propagate delete operations from the database, you should choose a different connector type like DB Changelog or DB Counter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#db-counter\">Counter</a> - This connector type is supported for any database table that has an indexed column that contains a sequence-based value that is automatically maintained and modified for each record that is added/updated. This column must be one of the following types: BIGINT, DECIMAL, INTEGER, or NUMERIC. If DECIMAL or NUMERIC are used, they should be declared without numbers after the dot: DECIMAL(6,0) not as DECIMAL(6,2). The DB Counter connector leverages this column to determine which records have changed since the last polling interval. This connector type can detect delete operations as long as the table has a dedicated “Change Type” column that indicates one of the following values: insert, update, delete. If the value is empty or something other than insert, update, or delete, an update operation is assumed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nIf none of these options are useable with your database, use a periodic cache refresh instead of real-time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>DB Changelog</strong></p>\n<p>RadiantOne can generate the SQL scripts which create the configuration needed to support the DB Changelog Connector. The scripts can be generated in the Main Control Panel. The following scripts are generated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>create_user.sql – Reminds you to have your DBA manually create a user account to be associated with the connector.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>create_capture.sql - Creates the log table and the triggers on the base table.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>drop_capture.sql - Drops the triggers and the log table.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>Note: for some databases the file is empty.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drop_user.sql - Drops the log table user and schema.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br> Note: for some databases the file is empty.</p>\n<h5 id=\"connector-configuration\">Connector Configuration</h5>\n<p>This section describes generating and executing the scripts in the Main Control Panel. The following steps assume the database backend has a changelog table that contains changed records that need to be updated in the persistent cache. The changelog table must have two key columns named RLICHANGETYPE and RLICHANGEID. RLICHANGETYPE must indicate insert, update or delete, dictating what type of change was made to the record. RLICHANGEID must be a sequence-based, auto-incremented INTEGER that contains a unique value for each record. The DB Changelog connector uses RLICHANGEID to maintain a cursor to keep track of processed changes.</p>\n<p>To configure DB Changelog connector:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\nThese instructions assume you want to apply the SQL scripts immediately and you already have a user account in the database to use for the connector.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>From the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace Tab, select the configured persistent cache branch below the Cache node.</li>\n<li>On the right side, select the Refresh Settings tab.</li>\n<li>When the Real-time refresh type is selected, the connectors appear in a table below. Select a connector and click <strong>Configure</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select DB Changelog from the Connector Type drop-down list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>5.Enter the log table name using the proper syntax for your database (e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;USER></code>.<code class=\"language-text\">&lt;TABLE>_LOG)</code>. If you used <a href=\"#log-table-name-syntax\">RadiantOne to generate the SQL scripts</a> for configuring the changelog components in the database, you can view the scripts to see the exact table name. Otherwise, contact your DBA for the log table name.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nChange the value for this property only if you are creating the log table manually and the capture connector does not calculate the log table name correctly. Be sure to use the <a href=\"#log-table-name-syntax\">correct syntax</a> if you change the value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Indicate the user name and password for the connector’s dedicated credentials for connecting to the log table. If you do not have the user name and password, contact your DBA for the credentials.

This change detection mechanism doesn’t require a connector process (or agents). If a RadiantOne service is virtualizing an external (non-local) RadiantOne Universal Directory store, and a persistent cache is configured for the view, this is considered an “LDAP backend” and the refresh connector can be configured for either changelog or persistent search (whatever is enabled/supported on the remote RadiantOne server) as described below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h6 id=\"ldap-directories\">LDAP Directories</h6>\n<p>For LDAP backends that support both Changelog and Persistent Search, you can configure the connector from the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace Tab.

The connector picks up changes from the cn=changelog naming context based on a polling interval. The changelog must be enabled in the backend directory. Please check with your directory vendor for instructions on how to enable the changelog.</p>\n<p><strong>Persistent Search</strong> - Any LDAP directory that offers a persistent search mechanism can use the Persistent Search connector type. Novell eDirectory is an example of an LDAP source that supports persistent search. Others include Red Hat Directory, IBM TDS, RadiantOne Universal Directory and CA Directory. The connector issues a persistent search and gets notified by the directory server when information changes. If the connector is shut down (either deliberately or due to failure), the delete operations that occurred in the directory are lost. Once the connector is back online there is no way to detect the delete operations that occurred while it was down. The only exception to this is for IBM TDS directories. It stores deleted entries and the capture connector is able to read them, and based on timestamp, determine if the change occurred while the connector was offline.</p>\n<h6 id=\"active-directory\">Active Directory</h6>\n<p>There are three change detection mechanisms: USNChanged, DirSync and Hybrid. If you are virtualizing and detecting changes from a Global Catalog, then you must use the USNChanged changed connector because the DirSync and Hybrid connectors cannot detect change events on sub-domains.</p>\n<p>The flowchart below helps to decide which change detection mechanism to use.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 97.45454545454545%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/82f2c944189d20d46ac87dd9975e81c4/b966c/Image2.17.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/82f2c944189d20d46ac87dd9975e81c4/c1cfe/Image2.17.jpg 275w,\n/static/82f2c944189d20d46ac87dd9975e81c4/67061/Image2.17.jpg 550w,\n/static/82f2c944189d20d46ac87dd9975e81c4/b966c/Image2.17.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.17: Selecting a Active Directory Change Detection Mechanism</p>\n<p><strong>The Active Directory DirSync</strong> capture connector retrieves changes that occur to entries by passing a cookie that identifies the directory state at the time of the previous DirSync search. The first time the DirSync capture connector is started, it stores a cookie in a cursor file. At the next polling interval, the connector performs a DirSync search to detect changes by sending the current cookie. To use the DirSync control, the Bind DN connecting to the directory must have the DS-Replication-Get-Changes extended right, which can be enabled with the “Replicating Directory Changes” permission, on the root of the partition being monitored. By default, this right is assigned to the Administrator and LocalSystem accounts on domain controllers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nTo detect delete events, the service account used by RadiantOne to connect to the backend Active Directory (configured in the connection string of the RadiantOne data source) must have permissions to search the tombstone objects. Usually, a member of the Administrators group is sufficient. However, some Active Directory servers may require a member of the Domain Admins group. Check with your Active Directory administrator to determine the appropriate credentials required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nIf you are virtualizing and detecting changes from a Global Catalog, then you must use the Active Directory USNChanged changed connector because the DirSync connector cannot detect change events on sub-domains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Active Directory USNChanged capture connector keeps track of changes based on the uSNChanged attribute for the entry. Based on a configured polling interval, the connector connects with the user and password configured in the connection string/data source and checks the list of changes stored by Active Directory.

The first time the connector starts, it gets a new cookie and the highest uSNchanged number. When the connector gets a new change (modify or delete), it makes an additional search using the DN of the entry and fetches the entry from AD. The fetched entry contains the uSNChanged attribute, so the connector updates the cursor values for both for the cookie and the last processed uSNchanged number.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nIf you are virtualizing and detecting changes from a Global Catalog, then you must use the Active Directory USNChanged changed connector because the Hybrid connector cannot detect change events on sub-domains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the connector restarts, uSNChanged detection catches the entries that have been modified or deleted while the connector was stopped. The LDAP search uses the last processed uSNChanged number to catch up. After the connector processes all entries, it requests a new cookie from Active Directory (not from the cursor) and switches to DirSync change detection.</p>\n<p><strong>RadiantOne Universal Directory Stores</strong></p>\n<p>If you are using a persistent cache on a proxy view of a local RadiantOne Universal Directory store, or a nested persistent cache view (a cached view used in another cached view), the connector type is noted as HDAP (trigger) automatically and cannot be changed.

There is no automatic failback, meaning once the primary server is back online, the connector doesn’t automatically go back to it.</p>\n<p>This failover mechanism is supported for Active Directory, OpenDJ, Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition (Sun Directory v7), Oracle Unified Directory (OUD). In addition, any LDAP directory implementing cn=changelog and replicationCSN attribute or the persistent search control is also supported.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nWhen the Active Directory DirSync connector fails over to another DC replica, the current cursor (cookie) is used. The connector may receive all objects and attributes from the replica instead of just the delta from its last request. Therefore, you may notice the number of entries published by the connector is more than you were expecting. This behavior is dictated by the Active Directory server and is out of the control of the connector. Keep this in mind when you define the Max Retries and Retry Intervals for the connector properties. The smaller the numbers of retries, the higher the chance the connector will fail over and possibly receive all objects and attributes (a full sync) from the domain controller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the Active Directory USNChanged connector, the failover logic leverages the Active Directory replication vectors [replUpToDateVector], and the failover servers configured at the level of the RadiantOne data source associated with Active Directory, to determine which server(s) the connector switches to in case of failure. Since the replication vector contains all domains, in addition to some possibly retired domains, the connector narrows down the list of possible failover candidates to only the ones listed as failover servers in the RadiantOne data source associated with the Active Directory backend. If there are no failover server defined for the data source, all domains in the replication vector are possible candidates for failover.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nWhen defining the RadiantOne data source associated with Active Directory, do not use Host Discovery or Load Balancers. You must use the fully qualified machine names for the primary server and failover servers. Do not use IP addresses. Also, it is highly recommended that you list your desired failover servers at the level of the data source. Not only does this make the failover logic more efficient, but it also avoids delays in synchronization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[replUpToDateVector] definition: The non-replicated attribute replUpToDateVector is an optional attribute on the naming context root of every naming context replica. If this vector is unavailable, the connector is suspended.</p>\n<p>The ReplUpToDateVector type is a tuple with the following fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>uuidDsa: The invocation ID of the DC that assigned usnHighPropUpdate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>usnHighPropUpdate: A USN at which an update was applied on the DC identified by uuidDsa.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>timeLastSyncSuccess: The time at which the last successful replication occurred from the DC identified by uuidDsa; for replication latency reporting only.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[replUpToDateVector] example:</p>\n<p>01ca6e90-7d20-4f9c-ba7b-823a72fc459e @ USN 2210490 @ Time 2005-08-21 15:54:21</p>\n<p>1d9bb4b6-054a-440c-aedf-7a3f28837e7f @ USN 26245013 @ Time 2007-02-27 10:17:33</p>\n<p>24980c9d-39fa-44d7-a153-c0c5c27f0577 @ USN 4606302 @ Time 2006-08-20 23:33:09</p>\n<p>At run-time, the connector retrieves the entire list of servers defined in the replication vector and reduces the number of possible failover candidates based on failover servers defined in the RadiantOne data source. The list of potential failover servers is stored at each polling interval. When the current server fails, the connector decides to switch to the closest candidate by selecting the server with the maximum timestamp from the up-to-dateness vector. The capture connector’s cursor will be assigned the value from the up-to-dateness vector for the failover server. If the closest candidate fails as well, the connector tries with a second closest candidate and so on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nDue to the lack of Active Directory replication for the USNChanged attribute, some changes could be missed or replayed on failover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the AD Hybrid connector, the failover process starts when the number of exceptions exceeds either the Maximum Retries on Error or Maximum Retries on Connection Error value. The failover servers are specified in the data source associated with Active Directory. The Active Directory up-to-date vector is used to determine the failover server and the value of the new cursor. If the up-to-date vector is unavailable from the current server, failover is not possible. If this happens, verify that AD replication is correctly configured. After the failover server is found, uSNChanged detection catches the entries that have been modified or deleted since the connector’s failure. The LDAP search uses the last processed uSNChanged number to catch up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nDue to the lack of Active Directory replication for the USNChanged attribute, some changes could be missed or replayed on failover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the connector processes all entries, it requests a new cookie from Active Directory and switches to DirSync change detection.</p>\n<h6 id=\"custom-connectors\">Custom Connectors</h6>\n<p>The following custom data sources support Real-time persistent cache refresh.

This is the amount of time (in milliseconds) the connector waits before trying to establish a connection to the source if there was a connection problem during the previous attempt. <br> This property is applicable to all connectors except HDAP triggers. The default value is 10,000 ms (10 seconds).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LDAP Filter</td>\n<td>To further condition the entries that are published, you can indicate the desired criteria in the LDAP Filter property. This is a post filter, used to qualify which entries are published by the connector. You must enter a valid LDAP filter in the property.<br> This property can be used to avoid publishing unwanted information.<br> If a captured entry matches the criteria indicated in the LDAP filter property, it is published by the connector. If it doesn’t, the entry is not published. Information about the skipped entries is in the connector log (with log level set to DEBUG). <br> If the captured change type is delete, and not enough information is known about the entry, the LDAP filter is not used and the entry is published by the connector. For example, if the LDAP filter property contained a value of (l=Novato) and the captured entry did not contain an “l” attribute, the LDAP filter is not applied and the entry is published. <br> If the captured change type is not delete (e.g. insert, update, move…etc.), and not enough information is known about the entry, the LDAP filter is still used and the entry is not published. For example, if the LDAP filter property contained a value of (l=Novato) and the captured entry did not contain an “l” attribute, the LDAP filter is still applied and the entry is not published by the connector.<br> This property is only applicable to Active Directory, LDAP and Persistent Search connectors. The default value is blank (no specific filter).<br> This property also plays a role in recovering changes that happen while a connector is stopped. The LDAP filter is added to the (internal) default filter used to further condition the entries to capture. For example, if the \"LDAP Filter\" property = <br> (|(objectclass=myProvider)(objectclass=myPerson)(objectclass=mySubscriber)), then, the following LDAP filter is used by the connector to capture changes that were missed while the connector was stopped:<br>(&#x26;(|(modifyTimestamp>=20211014212817.215Z)(createTimestamp>=20211014212817.215Z))(|(objectclass=myProvider)(objectclass=myPerson)(objectclass=mySubscriber))) <br> Note - If a change is made to this property while the connector is running, it must be restarted for the new value to take effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Excluded Branches</td>\n<td>To further condition the entries that are published, you can indicate branch(es) to exclude.

Only changes that match the filter are published by the connector. <br>A SQL filter is either a single expression or several single expressions joined by binary operators and brackets ( ). Possible binary operators are: <br>-\tAND <br> - OR <br> -NOT <br> Some examples of valid SQL Filters are: <br>- ID='5' <br> - ID='5' AND NAME='ALLEN' <br> -\tID='5' AND NAME='ALLEN' OR CITY='SAN FRANCISCO' <br> -\tID='5' AND (NAME='ALLEN' OR CITY='SAN FRANCISCO') <br> - NAME LIKE 'AL%' <br> -\tNAME LIKE 'ALLE_' <br> If the SQL Filter syntax entered into the property is not correct, an error is logged by the connector and it continues working without applying the SQL Filter (all changes are published). <br> This property is only applicable for the DB Changelog, DB Counter, and DB Timestamp connectors. The default value is blank (no specific filter).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Force Sequential Counters (true/false)</td>\n<td>This property accepts a value of true or false and dictates how the connector treats entries it picks up from the LOG table that have non-sequential change IDs. The default is true meaning that if the connector detects a non-sequential change ID for an entry in the LOG table, it behaves as if there is an error (non-connection error) and the retry logic based on the Max Retries on Error and Retry Interval on Error properties takes effect. Sometimes rows in the log table are not written in the order of the change ID, and if the connector doesn’t wait for the entries to have sequential IDs, some changes could be missed. The connector waits for the length of time specified in the Retry Interval on Error property and then tries to get the changed entries in the database again. After the maximum number of retries (indicated in the Max Retries on Error property) is exhausted, if it still detects non-sequential change IDs, the connector stops. Set “Force Sequential Counters” to false before restarting the connector to have the connector ignore non-sequential change IDs. <br> If the connector should ignore non-sequential change IDs, and process all changes immediately, set the property to false.<br> This property is only applicable to the DB Changelog and DB Counter connectors. The default value is true.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Processing Delay</td>\n<td>This property can be used if there is a need for a delay in the processing of changes by the connector. For example, if there are two or more processes that update the source table at the same time, and they take about 2 minutes each to run, the processing delay can be set at anywhere between 4-6 minutes. This delays the processing and makes sure the connector captures all changes coming from both processes. <br> The property value is in seconds, and the default value is 0. If the value is set to &#x3C;=0, it means that the property is ignored by the connector. If the value is set to be more than 0, then only the entries between last_cursor and current_time – processing_delay are processed by the connector. If an invalid, non-numeric value is set for this property, the connector stops. <br> This property is only applicable to the DB Timestamp connector.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Skip catch-up process (true/false)</td>\n<td>If this option is set to false, when the connector starts, it tries to pick up all changes that happened since the last time it successfully processed any changes (this information is maintained in the connector’s cursor file). This is based on changenumber. If this option is set to true, the connector sends out only the changes that happen after it has started. All changes that happened while the connector was stopped are ignored. <br> The property is applicable to the Persistent Search connector only. The default value is false.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Switch to Primary Server (in Polling Intervals)</td>\n<td>This option, working in conjunction with the Polling Interval property, allows you to configure how often, if at all, the connector attempts to switch back to the primary server after failover. To configure the connector to attempt to switch to the primary server, set Switch to Primary Server to a value of 4 or greater. You can set the value to less than 4, but attempting to connect back to the primary server can be time consuming and therefore not recommended to do frequently. For example, if this value is set to 1, the connector makes an attempt every polling interval. If the Switch to Primary Server value is 3, the connector makes an attempt every third polling interval. <br> To disable attempts to reconnect to the primary server, set this value to zero. This is the default value. <br> Changes made to this property’s value while the connector is running are immediately taken into account. When the connector starts or restarts and the property value is 1 or higher, the connector attempts to switch to the primary server immediately. <br> This property is applicable to the LDAP changelog connectors only.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failover Algorithm [1-4]</td>\n<td>This option is relevant for the LDAP changelog connector type.<br> When a failover happens, the changelog capture connector attempts to find a new cursor. Since this process is inexact, and changenumber sequence can vary across some replica servers, some events may be replayed or lost. The changelog connector maintains a cursor that indicates information related to the last change processed by the connector along with information about possible replica servers in case failover is needed. During failover, the connector searches the changelog of the replica servers and determines minimum and maximum changenumbers across them. Assume that the last processed changenumber stored by the connector is 100 and there are 2 replica servers defined for the backend. During failover, the connector determines the current changenumbers for each of the replicas by searching their changelogs. Assume that replica 1 has changenumber 99 and replica 2 has changenumber 97. When the connector needs to failover, it must decide whether to start processing changes using changenumber 100 (its current last processed change), 97 (changenumber from replica 2), or 99 (changenumber from replica 1). <br> The Failover Algorithm property allows you to determine how the cursor value gets set during failover, and ultimately determine the quantity of events that are replayed. The property supports values between 1 and 4. The meaning of each is outlined in the table below. <br> <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 436px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 58.18181818181818%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/3e10e17ce37bc8fc5033ea3b73da75f1/4c32f/failover-algorithm.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3e10e17ce37bc8fc5033ea3b73da75f1/c1cfe/failover-algorithm.jpg 275w,\n/static/3e10e17ce37bc8fc5033ea3b73da75f1/4c32f/failover-algorithm.jpg 436w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h6 id=\"resetting-connector-cursor--detect-new-only\">Resetting Connector Cursor – Detect New Only</h6>\n<p>Capture connectors use a cursor to maintain information about the last processed changes. This allows the connectors to capture only changes that have happened since the last time they checked for changes. When the real-time persistent cache refresh connectors start, they automatically attempt to capture all changes that have happened since the last time they checked. If the real-time persistent cache refresh process has been stopped for an extended period of time, you might not want them to attempt to capture all changes since the last time they checked. In this case, you can reset the cursor for the connector. From the Main Control Panel > PCache Monitoring tab, select the real-time refresh topology and the topology displays. Click the icon representing the capture connector and the Runtime details are displayed on the right. Click <strong>Reset Cursor</strong> to clear the cursor value and trigger the connector to behave as if it is the first time connecting to the source to collect changes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"persistent-cache-properties\">Persistent Cache Properties</h4>\n<p>Once a persistent cache is configured, properties can be managed from the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab > Cache node. Select the configured persistent cache branch and the properties are available on the right.</p>\n<h5 id=\"non-indexed-attributes\">Non-indexed Attributes</h5>\n<p>If the Indexed Attributes list is empty, all attributes are indexed by default (except binary ones). Also, the following “internal” ones won’t be indexed either: \"creatorsName\", \"createTimestamp\", \"modifiersName\", \"modifyTimestamp\", \"cacheCreatorsName\", \"cacheCreateTimestamp\", \"cacheModifiersName\", \"cacheModifyTimestamp\", \"uuid\", \"vdsSyncState\", \"vdsSyncHist\", \"ds-sync-generation-id\", \"ds-sync-state\", \"ds-sync-hist\", \"vdsSyncCursor\", \"entryUUID\", \"userpassword”. Any additional attributes that you do not want indexed should be added to the Non Indexed Attributes list on the Properties tab for the selected persistent cache branch.</p>\n<p>If you change the non-indexed attributes, you must re-build the index. You can do this from the Properties tab by clicking <strong>Re-build Index</strong>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"sorted-attributes\">Sorted Attributes</h5>\n<p>This is a comma-separated list of attributes to be used in association with Virtual List Views (VLV) or sort control configured for RadiantOne. These sorted indexes are managed internally in the persistent cache and kept optimized for sorting. They are required if you need to sort the search result or to execute a VLV query on the persistent cache branch.</p>\n<p>If you need to support VLV, the VLV/Sort control must be enabled in RadiantOne. For details on this control, please see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n<p>If you change the sorted attributes, you must re-build the index. You can do this from the Properties tab by clicking <strong>Re-build Index</strong>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"encrypted-attributes\">Encrypted Attributes</h5>\n<p>Attribute encryption protects sensitive data while it is stored in RadiantOne. You can specify that certain attributes of an entry are stored in an encrypted format. This prevents data from being readable while stored in persistent cache, backup files, and exported LDIF files. Attribute values are encrypted before they are stored in persistent cache, and decrypted before being returned to the client, as long as the client is authorized to read the attribute (based on ACLs defined in RadiantOne), is connected to the RadiantOne service via SSL, and not a member of the special group containing members not allowed to get these attributes (e.g. cn=ClearAttributesOnly,cn=globalgroups,cn=config). For details on this special group, please see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nDefine a security encryption key from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Attribute Encryption prior to configuring encrypted attributes. For steps on defining key generation, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the Properties Tab for the selected persistent cache, enter a comma-separated list of attributes to store encrypted in the Encrypted Attributes property. Attributes listed in the Encrypted Attributes property are added to the Non-indexed attribute list by default. This means these attributes are not searchable by default. Indexing encrypted attributes is generally not advised as the index itself is less secure than the attribute stored in the persistent cache. However, if you must be able to search on the encrypted attribute value, it must be indexed. Only “exact match/equality” index is supported for encrypted attributes. To make an encrypted attribute searchable, remove the attribute from the list of nonindexed attributes and then click <strong>Re-build Index</strong>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"extension-attributes\">Extension Attributes</h5>\n<p>Extension Attributes are new attributes (meaning these attributes don’t exist anywhere yet) that are associated with a cached virtual entry. This is primarily used to accommodate the storage of application-specific attributes that you want to store locally as opposed to the backend(s) you are virtualizing. Extension attributes should be used as an alternative to Extended Joins in scenarios where the virtual view is stored in persistent cache and then needs replicated out to RadiantOne Universal Directory stores in other clusters.</p>\n<p>Extension attributes are stored locally and RadiantOne handles the lifecycle of these attributes accordingly. Once a persistent cache is defined, list the attribute names (comma-separated) in the Extension Attributes property. The attribute names must be unique and not overlap with attributes coming from and being cached from existing backends. The example below has an extension attribute named lastLogin. Applications can write to this attribute and RadiantOne handles the write locally without delegating anything to the backend.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 899px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 68.36363636363636%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4bf496f7587ef88b94dd9c8391d54aff/2d452/Image2.23.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4bf496f7587ef88b94dd9c8391d54aff/c1cfe/Image2.23.jpg 275w,\n/static/4bf496f7587ef88b94dd9c8391d54aff/67061/Image2.23.jpg 550w,\n/static/4bf496f7587ef88b94dd9c8391d54aff/2d452/Image2.23.jpg 899w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.23: Extension Attributes for Persistent Cache</p>\n<p>For consistency of the RadiantOne LDAP schema, define the extension attributes as part of the schema, generally associated with an auxiliary object class.

Below are some invariant attributes used in common LDAP directories.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>objectGUID (Active Directory)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>entryUUID (Oracle Unified Directory, OpenDJ, unboundID)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>nsUniqueID (Sun/ODSEE)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ibm-entryUUID (IBM)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UUID (RadiantOne Universal Directory)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the example shown below, the persistent cached view is from an Active Directory backend. RadiantOne manages the lifecycle of the attribute named lastLogin and this attribute is stored directly in the cache. The invariant attribute is set to objectGUID which is the unique identifier for the users in the backend Active Directory. If the entry in the backend is moved, the invariant attribute ensures RadiantOne handles the move of the associated cached extension attributes properly.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 899px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 68.36363636363636%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/0a8fd86f0d0f6fa43cdb027ed5c7652a/2d452/Image2.24.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0a8fd86f0d0f6fa43cdb027ed5c7652a/c1cfe/Image2.24.jpg 275w,\n/static/0a8fd86f0d0f6fa43cdb027ed5c7652a/67061/Image2.24.jpg 550w,\n/static/0a8fd86f0d0f6fa43cdb027ed5c7652a/2d452/Image2.24.jpg 899w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.24: Invariant Attribute for Persistent Cache</p>\n<h5 id=\"inter-cluster-replication\">Inter-cluster Replication</h5>\n<p>This option should be enabled if you want to support replication between this persistent cache branch and a RadiantOne Universal Directory store in a different cluster.</p>\n<p>If inter-cluster replication is enabled, a replication journal is used to store changes that happen on the persistent cache branch. The replication journal is associated with the default LDAP data source defined as replicationjournal and root naming context named cn=replicationjournal. The RadiantOne leader node in the cluster associated with the persistent cache, publishes changes into the replication journal. The RadiantOne leader nodes in all other clusters (that are configured for inter-cluster replication) pick up changes from the replication journal to update their local replica. Persistent caches usually only publish changes into the replication journal (for other RadiantOne Universal Directory replicas in other clusters). There are some cases where persistent cache can accept changes from other clusters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nChanges that haven’t been picked up from the replicationjournal for 3 days are automatically purged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"accept-changes-from-replicas\">Accept Changes from Replicas</h5>\n<p>For limited use cases where the only type of modify operations that client applications perform is updates to existing entries (no adds or deletes), the persistent cache can subscribe to these events. If the persistent cache should process attribute updates from RadiantOne Universal Directory replicas in other clusters, enable the Accept Changes from Replicas option and list the acceptable attributes in the Updateable Attributes from Replicas property.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nPersistent Cache stores can only accept modification operations from RadiantOne Universal Directory replicas. Add and delete operations are currently not supported. Therefore, proper ACLs should be configured for the RadiantOne Universal Directory replicas to prevent the addition and deletion of entries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nThis is an advanced setting, consult with a Radiant Logic Solution Architect to get assistance on the needed architecture and usage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"updateable-attributes-from-replicas\">Updateable Attributes from Replicas</h5>\n<p>A comma-separated list of attribute names that the persistent cache should accept changes for. Only changes made to these attributes are processed by the persistent cache. All other changes published in the replication journal from the RadiantOne Universal Directory replicas are ignored by the persistent cache. If an updateable attribute is associated with an extension attribute in the persistent cache, the attribute update is handled locally. If an updateable attribute is sourced from a backend data source, the update is forwarded to the appropriate backend and the cache image is refreshed after the backend update is successful. If the backend update fails, the current persistent cache image is considered the reference and is published to the replication journal to override the images in the RadiantOne Universal Directory replicas in all other clusters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nPersistent Cache stores can only accept modification operations from RadiantOne Universal Directory replicas.

If the password in the backend is encrypted using one of the algorithms supported by RadiantOne, and the passwords are stored in the cache, you can configure the service to authenticate the user locally against the password in cache instead of delegating the credentials checking to the backend. To enable this behavior, check the Use Cache for Authentication option on the configured cache branch. This option is not applicable in scenarios where the passwords are not stored in the persistent cache. For an example use case where this option could be applicable, please see <a href=\"07-deployment-architecture#backends-inaccessible-by-all-sites\">Authoritative Backends Inaccessible by All Sites</a>.</p>\n<p>By default, if the Use Cache for Authentication option is enabled and the entry in persistent cache has a password, RadiantOne checks the password against the local value and the user is authenticated or not based on this comparison. If the entry in persistent cache doesn’t have a password, RadiantOne delegates the credentials checking to the backend data source. There are two options to override this default behavior: Local Bind Only or Delegate on Failure.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 10.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ee5d3b554026aa87807a3cc70088d47d/b966c/Image2.25.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ee5d3b554026aa87807a3cc70088d47d/c1cfe/Image2.25.jpg 275w,\n/static/ee5d3b554026aa87807a3cc70088d47d/67061/Image2.25.jpg 550w,\n/static/ee5d3b554026aa87807a3cc70088d47d/b966c/Image2.25.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.25: Authentication Options</p>\n<p>Each option is described in more details below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Local Bind Only – If this option is enabled and the user entry in cache either has no password or the bind fails, RadiantOne does not delegate the credentials checking to the backend. It determines if the user authentication fails based on the local comparison.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delegate on Failure – If this option is enabled and the user entry in cache has a password but the local checking fails, RadiantOne delegates the credentials checking to the backend. If the credentials checking fails against the backend, an unsuccessful bind response is returned to the client. If the credentials checking succeeds against the backend, a successful bind response is returned to the client.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable Password Policy Enforcement - If you are storing user passwords in cache and you are using the cache for authentication, you can also choose to have RadiantOne enforce password policies (as opposed to delegating password checking to the backend directory and having it enforce password policies). Enable this option and then define the password policy to enforce. For details on password policies, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you enable the password policy enforcement on a persistent cache, the userPassword attribute is automatically added to the Extension Attribute property and you have the option to enable Password Write Back. If Password Write Back is enabled, and a modify request for the password is sent to RadiantOne, it tries to update the password in the backend. In some circumstances, having two levels of password policies can result in inconsistencies between the cache image and the underlying backend(s). These circumstances are outlined in the table below.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Password Change Event</th>\n<th>Password Writeback Enabled?</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Password update via a Modify Request sent to RadiantOne</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>The password is updated in the persistent cache if it complies with the persistent cache password policy. Otherwise the password update fails. <br> <br> The password update is not sent to the backend. If the update to the persistent cache succeeds, the password in the persistent cache will be different than the one in the backend.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Password update via a Modify Request sent to RadiantOne</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>The password update is sent to the backend. If the password update fails in the backend, the password in the persistent cache is not updated. If the password update succeeds in the backend, the password is updated in the persistent cache.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Password is updated directly in the backend (outside of RadiantOne)</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Through the persistent cache refresh process, the password is updated in the persistent cache. If the account was locked in the persistent cache due to a password policy enforced at the cache layer, it will be unlocked by the cache refresh process after a successful password update in the backend. Password strength defined in the persistent cache password policy is not enforced since the password change originated from the backend.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h5 id=\"active\">Active</h5>\n<p>Check the Active option if you want to Activate this naming context. Uncheck the Active option to deactivate the cache. If a persistent cache is deactivated, RadiantOne issues queries to the backend(s) when processing client requests.</p>\n<h5 id=\"full-text-search\">Full-text Search</h5>\n<p>Persistent cache branches can support full text searches. This offers additional flexibility for clients as they can search data in the RadiantOne namespace based on text (character) data. These types of searches are no longer linked to specific attributes as the characters requested could be found in any attribute value. An entry is returned if any attribute in the entry contains the character string(s) requested by the client.</p>\n<p>Clients issue full text searches similar to the way they issue LDAP searches. The only difference is the filter contains <code class=\"language-text\">(fulltext=&lt;value>)</code> where <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;value></code> would be the text they are interested in. As an example, if a client was interested in the text John Doe as an exact phrase, the search filter sent to RadiantOne would be (fulltext= “John Doe”) where the phrase is encapsulated in double quotes. If the phrase in the filter is not encapsulated in double quotes it means the client wants any entries that have attribute values that contain the character string John OR Doe.</p>\n<p>The part of the filter that contains the piece related to the full text search can also be combined with other “standard” LDAP operators. As an example, a filter could be something like (&#x26;(uid=sjones)(fulltext=”John Doe”)). This would return entries that contain a uid attribute with the value sjones AND any other attribute that contains the exact character string John Doe.</p>\n<p>If you want the persistent cache to support full text searches, check the Full-Text Search option and click <strong>Save</strong>. If you add the support for full text searches, click <strong>Re-build Index</strong>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"optimize-linked-attributes\">Optimize Linked Attributes</h5>\n<p>Linked attributes are attributes that allow relationships between objects. A typical example would be isMemberOf/uniqueMember for user/groups objects. A group has members (uniqueMember attribute) which is the forward link relationship. Those members have an isMemberOf attribute which is the back link (to the group entry) relationship. Other examples of linked attributes are:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>manager/directReports\naltRecipient/altRecipientBL\ndLMemRejectPerms/dLMemRejectPermsBL\ndLMemSubmitPerms/dLMemSubmitPermsBL\nmsExchArchiveDatabaseLink/msExchArchiveDatabaseLinkBL\nmsExchDelegateListLink/msExchDelegateListBL\npublicDelegates/publicDelegatesBL\nowner/ownerBL</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">manager/directReports\naltRecipient/altRecipientBL\ndLMemRejectPerms/dLMemRejectPermsBL\ndLMemSubmitPerms/dLMemSubmitPermsBL\nmsExchArchiveDatabaseLink/msExchArchiveDatabaseLinkBL\nmsExchDelegateListLink/msExchDelegateListBL\npublicDelegates/publicDelegatesBL\nowner/ownerBL</code></pre></div>\n<p>The most common back link/forward link relationship is between group and user objects. A list of groups a user is a member of can be calculated automatically by RadiantOne and returned in the membership attribute of the user entry. The most common back link attributes are in the drop-down list. However, you can manually enter any attribute name you want. This is configured on the Main Control Panel, click Settings > Interception > Special Attributes Handling > Linked Attributes setting (on the right).</p>\n<p>If the Target Base DN (back link attribute location) and the Source Base DN (forward link attribute location) in the Linked Attributes setting is a persistent cached branch, the computation of the references can be optimized in order to return client requests for the back link attribute at high speed. To enable this optimization, follow the steps below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nIf your linked attributes are for users and groups (both branches located in persistent cache), and you enable the Optimize Linked Attributes setting, and must support nested groups, only one user location per persistent cache store is supported. For example, in the Linked Attributes setting, having a Target Base DN location configured for ou=people1,dc=myhdap and ou=people2,dc=myhdap (both in the same dc=myhdap persistent cache store) is not supported. In this case, you should configure a single user location as dc=myhdap as a shared parent for both containers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is assumed you have configured and initialized your persistent cache, and configured the Linked Attributes in Special Attributes Handling. If you have not, please do so prior to continuing with the steps below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 343px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 59.63636363636364%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8f4757535013efda5f9eff70bacb365c/4f01a/Image2.29.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8f4757535013efda5f9eff70bacb365c/c1cfe/Image2.29.jpg 275w,\n/static/8f4757535013efda5f9eff70bacb365c/4f01a/Image2.29.jpg 343w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.29: Back Link Attribute Name in Special Attribute Handling</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Select the Optimize Linked Attributes option on the Properties tab for the selected persistent cache branch on the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab > Cache section.

This can be useful if you want to replicate this cache image across multiple RadiantOne clusters. To export the cached branch, from the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace Tab, select the persistent cache branch below the Cache node. On the Properties Tab on the right side, click the Export button. Enter a name, select a type of file (LDIF or LDIFZ which is a zipped and encrypted file) and click <strong>OK</strong>. If you want to use this LDIF file to initialize a cache or Universal Directory store in another cluster, use the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Configuration > File Manager to browse to &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/ldif/export to download the file. Then, connect to the Main Control Panel in the target environment where you want to use the LDIF file and use the Settings Tab > Configuration > File Manager to navigate to &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/ldif/import to upload the LDIF file. When you initialize the cache in the target environment, browse to this location to locate the file to use for initialization.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\nIf exporting to an LDIFZ file, a security key must be configured. This key is the same as the one used for attribute encryption. Any target server (persistent cache or RadiantOne Universal Directory store) where you want to import this LDIFZ file must use the same security key value. The security key is defined from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security > Attribute Encryption section. If an LDIFZ encryption key is defined, only the ldifz file type is available when exporting to LDIF from the Main Control Panel > Directory Browser tab.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 401px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 40%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ceff596ce3e0fe2f63096f88292a66d1/f6c81/Image2.31.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ceff596ce3e0fe2f63096f88292a66d1/c1cfe/Image2.31.jpg 275w,\n/static/ceff596ce3e0fe2f63096f88292a66d1/f6c81/Image2.31.jpg 401w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.31: Exporting an LDIFZ file</p>\n<h5 id=\"testing-persistent-cache-refresh-process\">Testing Persistent Cache Refresh Process</h5>\n<p>To test the persistent cache refresh process, use an LDAP command line utility like the one described below. If the connectors are running, suspend them from the Main Control Panel > PCache Monitoring tab.</p>\n<p>The ldapsearch utility offered in the Sun Resource Kit can be used to force a refresh of the persistent cache based on a specific DN. The command would look similar to the following:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>ldapsearch -h 10.11.12.91 -p 2389 -D &quot;cn=directory manager&quot; -w &quot;secret&quot; -b &quot;action=synchronizecache,customers=ALFKI,dv=northwind,o=vds&quot; -s base (objectclass=*)</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ldapsearch -h 10.11.12.91 -p 2389 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -w \"secret\" -b \"action=synchronizecache,customers=ALFKI,dv=northwind,o=vds\" -s base (objectclass=*)</code></pre></div>\n<p>The above command refreshes the single entry identified by the DN of customers=ALFKI,dv=northwind,o=vds. If you want to refresh multiple entries with a single command, you can use a ONE LEVEL or SUBTREE scope. If you wanted to refresh all entries below dv=northwind, the command would be:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>ldapsearch -h 10.11.12.91 -p 2389 -D &quot;cn=directory manager&quot; -w &quot;secret&quot; -b &quot;action=synchronizecache,dv=northwind,o=vds&quot; -s one (objectclass=*)</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ldapsearch -h 10.11.12.91 -p 2389 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -w \"secret\" -b \"action=synchronizecache,dv=northwind,o=vds\" -s one (objectclass=*)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Each parameter of the command is described below.</p>\n<p>-h is the RadiantOne server name or IP address.</p>\n<p>-p is the LDAP port RadiantOne is listening on.</p>\n<p>-D is the user to connect to RadiantOne as.</p>\n<p>-w is the password for the user you are connecting with.</p>\n<p>-b is the DN for the entry in the persistent cache that you want refreshed (if a base scope). If a one level, or sub tree scope is used, then -b is the starting point in the persistent cache to start refreshing from.</p>\n<p>-s is the scope of the search which should be base, one or sub.</p>\n<p>(objectclass=*) is the filter.</p>\n<p>Modify the above command to match your requirement. Keep the following in mind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Always connect to RadiantOne as the directory manager</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Replace the DN with your own (always start with action=synchronizecache,)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To test, first modify the information in the underlying source. The persistent cache should not reflect any change. Next, execute the ldapsearch command mentioned above. Now, the persistent cache should reflect the new entry. Be sure to check all log files if the persistent cache did not get refreshed properly.</p>\n<h5 id=\"logging-persistent-cache-refreshes\">Logging Persistent Cache Refreshes</h5>\n<p>If the change log has been enabled for RadiantOne, then all changes affecting the persistent cache are logged there. Otherwise, all activity to the persistent cache is logged into a branch in the RadiantOne namespace with a root suffix of cn=cacherefreshlog. This branch only stores changes that affect persistent cache branches.</p>\n<p>Logging of persistent cache changes into the cn=cacherefreshlog is always enabled and different log levels can be configured. The log level is set on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Changelog sub-section. Select the drop-down list next to the Persistent Cache Refresh Log option on the right side and choose a log level. The log levels are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Error – logs only errors that occur when trying to refresh the persistent cache. This is the default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Status – logs the status (and the DN that was refreshed) when refreshes are made to the persistent cache.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All – logs all refreshes to the persistent cache including the changes that occurred.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Entries remain in the cn=cacherefreshlog for a default of 3 days. This is configurable and defined in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Changelog sub-section, Changelog and Journal Stores Max Age property. This property is shared by the following internal stores.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>cn=changelog</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cn=cacherefreshlog</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cn=replicationjournal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cn=localjournal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cn=tombstone</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cn=clustermonitor</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cn=queue</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cn=dlqueue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typically, if the changelog has been enabled then error log level is used for the persistent cache refresh log.
