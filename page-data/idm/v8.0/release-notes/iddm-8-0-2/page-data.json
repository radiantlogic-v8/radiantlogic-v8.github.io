The feature is enabled out of the box but needs to be configured to be able to send emails. In the event of a logging failure, this feature will make an attempt to alert the user, but will gracefully fail and will not interfere with the application's state if the attempt fails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-500]: Improve the Secure Data Connector agent to support a proxy property for custom data sources to allow for reaching these sources through a proxy server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-662]: Made an improvement so when the LDAP port or Admin HTTP port is disabled, automatically enable internal client SSL and set the cluster communication mode to always use SSL (instead of requiring this to be done manually).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-676]: Improved logging output for computed attributes so that runtime errors or dynamic compilation errors are easier to troubleshoot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-680]: Renamed Universal Directory and HDAP to RadiantOne Directory to match new Marketing messaging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-682]: Improvement to remove trace level Logging from Zookeeper.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-689]: Made an improvement so that the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace nodes are still accessible, even when the internal check to determine if a persistent cache is configured for this node fails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-698]: Renamed the Save button to OK in the Create New Attribute screen to avoid confusion because the SCIM schema is not saved until the user exits out of the Create New Attribute screen and clicks Save on the Create new Schema page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-699]: Added a toggle to enable/disable adaptive change mode for Synchronization > Rules-based transformations to allow customers to disable this if needed, like in cases where they need more control over the LDAP operation type for handling multi-valued attributes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-703]: Improved the directory namespace rendering time when hundreds of naming contexts are deployed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-721]: Improvement to increase the Control Panel timeout used when backing up RadiantOne directory stores to avoid errors when backing up very large (e.g. 1 million+ entries) stores.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-765]: Made an improvement so that the permission filter warning is not output to the web.log every time a node is selected in the Directory Namespace tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-766]: Added AM/PM details to the Last Login Time in the Control Panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-781]: Improved the display of TLS/SSL protocols to show the ones that are actually enabled in RadiantOne rather than simply the JDK's default enabled protocols list.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security-vulnerability-fixes\">Security Vulnerability Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-565]: Upgraded jersey-hk2 jar to 2.34 to address CVE-2021-28168.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-770]: Upgraded Postgres jar to 42.6.1 to remediate potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-771]: Upgraded org.apache.commons:commons-comopress jar to 1.26.0 to remediate potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-783]: Upgraded Spring libraries to 5.3.33 and Spring security to 5.7.12 to remediate potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-807]: Upgraded bouncy castle jars to address CVE-2024-30172 and CVE-2024-30171.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-839]: Upgraded Spring core libraries to 5.3.36 to address CVE-2024-22262.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"bug-fixes\">Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-359]: Fixed an issue where when caching is enabled in the Dynamic Group Setting, the users who were added to the global groups dynamically were not able to authenticate.

The Clusters tab buttons now work when periods are in the cluster name.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-702]: Fixed an issue where LDAP queries requiring controls should be rejected if the control is critical and not supported by RadiantOne Directory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-704]: Fixed an issue with Synchronization, \"Target Attribute Mappings\" with same names in different Rules-Based-Sync Pipelines causing a file conflict and config overwrite.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-705]: Fixed an issue so that the AD password filter connector tries to return an entry even if the partial results exception is thrown.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-706]: Fixed an issue where the OIDC configuration in RadiantOne with additional scopes is being passed to the authorization server even though the user is only requesting the “openid” scope in the configuration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-709]: Fixed an issue with editing Suffix Branch inclusion/exclusion from the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-712]: Fixed an issue with the migration tool when attribute encryption is used that would prevent the encrypted directories to be imported back.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[VMR-735]: Fixed an issue in Synchronization, rules-based transformation that sometimes caused target object class values to be lower-cased.
