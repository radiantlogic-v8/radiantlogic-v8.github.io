This type of replication is referred to as inter-cluster replication. The state of inter-cluster replication can be monitored from the Replication Monitoring Tab.</p>\n<p><strong>Central Journal Replication</strong></p>\n<p>The default, recommended replication model for RadiantOne Universal Directory stores is based on a publish-and-subscribe methodology. When writes occur on a site, the leader node publishes the changes into a central journal. The leader nodes on all other sites pick up the changes from the central journal and update their local stores. These changes are then automatically replicated out to follower/follower-only nodes within the cluster. For more details on inter-cluster replication, please see the RadiantOne Deployment and Tuning Guide.</p>\n<p>If inter-cluster replication is enabled, the clusters that are participating in replication can be viewed in the Central Journal Replication section. The topology depicts the connectivity between the clusters and the cluster housing the replication journal. If a red line is visible, this indicates a connection problem between a cluster and the replication journal.</p>\n<p>An example is shown below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 38.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing central journal replication \"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/85533bdb5b2b2cd97e90c9ca20b79acb/b966c/replication.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/85533bdb5b2b2cd97e90c9ca20b79acb/c1cfe/replication.jpg 275w,\n/static/85533bdb5b2b2cd97e90c9ca20b79acb/67061/replication.jpg 550w,\n/static/85533bdb5b2b2cd97e90c9ca20b79acb/b966c/replication.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Column Name</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>HDAP Store</td>\n<td>The root naming context that stores the entries to be replicated across all clusters.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cluster Name</td>\n<td>The cluster name, as defined during the RadiantOne installation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Changes Subscribed (Applied)</td>\n<td>The number of changes replicated to this cluster.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Changes Subscribed (Pending)</td>\n<td>The number of changes waiting to be replicated to this cluster.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Changes Published</td>\n<td>This value is a total of the number of applied and pending changes.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>More than one store per cluster can be participating in inter-cluster replication.

For example, an update made by a client to one data center might not be replicated to other data centers in time for the client to immediately read the change, if the read request it sent to a different data center than the update was. This is generally not an ideal load distribution policy when working with distributed systems. Load balancing is best deployed across multiple nodes within the same cluster on the same site/data center.</p>\n<p>In any event, to address scenarios like this, a push replication mode can be used to send the changes directly to the intended targets. The targets must be other RadiantOne servers defined as LDAP data sources. For more details on Push Mode Replication, please see the RadiantOne Deployment and Tuning Guide.</p>\n<p>If push mode replication is enabled, the clusters that are participating in replication can be viewed in the table in the Push Mode Replication section. The table lists, for each store, the clusters involved in replication.

In the Main Control Panel go to Settings → Monitoring → Standard Alerts.\r\n2. Expand the Advanced section.\r\n3. In the Alert Script field, enter the pathname to your script file (.bat file on Windows, .sh on Unix systems).\r\n\r\n![An image showing enabling an alert script ](Media/Image1.5.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 1.5 : Enabling an Alert Script from the Main Control Panel\r\n\r\n4. Click Save.\r\n\r\nTo generate additional alert information, you can append your custom script mentioned above with the following four arguments.\r\n\r\n| Argument | Description | Examples |\r\n|----------|-------------|---------------------|\r\n| 1 | Category | - “default_connections” <br> - “default_data_sources” <br> - \"<node ID>\" (for custom alerts)\r\n| 2 | Status | - True=threshold exceeded. <br> - False=value below threshold. | \r\n| 3 | Name | - “connections in use...” <br> - “disk usage above...” <br> - “CPU usage above threshold” | \r\n| 4 | Registered value | This argument displays the registered value only if the associated alert is triggered. | \r\n\r\nTo modify your custom script to output these alert descriptions:\r\n\r\n1. Open your custom script in a text editor such as Notepad.\r\n2. Append the script. The following example (Windows systems) calls for all four arguments and generates a text file called “alerts”.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\necho %1 %2 %3 %4 >>C:\\radiantone\\vds\\alerts.txt\r\n```\r\n3. Save the file.\r\n4. Navigate in the file system to the file location and open the file.

The following table describes each status.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Status | Description | \r\n|--------|---------------------------|\r\n| On | RadiantOne can connect to the data source. | \r\n| Off | The connection test to the data source failed. | \r\n| Offline | The data source’s active property is set to false. | \r\n| Unavailable | No classname property is defined for the data source. | \r\n\r\nIf a data source has failover servers configured, the URL in the message indicates which server the status applies to.\r\n\r\nTo configure alerts for data source availability:\r\n\r\n1. In the Main Control Panel go to Settings Tab > Monitoring section > Standard Alerts sub-section.\r\n2. In the Data Sources section, there is the option to enable/disable alerts when a data source is disconnected (unreachable).\r\n\r\n![An image showing configurating a data source](Media/Image1.11.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 1.11 : Configuring a Data Source Alert from the Main Control Panel\r\n\r\n3. Define the interval to check the data source availability. The default is 120 seconds.\r\n4. File alerts are enabled by default. If SMTP settings are configured in the Monitoring > Email Alert Settings section you can also use the Email Alert output.\r\n5. Click the field next to “Data sources to monitor:” and select a data source from the drop-down menu. The vds data source is selected by default and is used to monitor the RadiantOne service and alert when the service is stopped or started.\r\n\r\n![An image showing selecting a data source to monitor ](Media/Image1.12.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 1.12: Selecting a Data Source to Monitor\r\n\r\n6.

A user can belong to multiple groups. The following administration groups are\r\ndefined for RadiantOne:\r\n\r\n- Directory Administrator Role\r\n- Read Only Role\r\n- Namespace Administrator Role\r\n- Operator Role\r\n- Schema Administrator Role\r\n- ACI Administrator Role\r\n- ICS Administrator Role\r\n- ICS Operator Role\r\n\r\nFor details on the operations allowed for each user, please see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.\r\n\r\nWhen any user that is a member of one of the above delegated administration groups saves changes in the Main or Server Control Panel, this activity is logged into: web_access.log. This is a CSV formatted log file with the delimiter being `<TAB>`. To configure the log output for the Control Panel, navigate to the Main\r\nControl Panel > Settings tab > Logs > Log Settings section. You can view and download web_access.log from Server Control Panel > Log Viewer.\r\n\r\nSelect Control Panel – Access from the Log Settings to Configure drop-down list. Define the log level, rollover size and number of files to keep archived.\r\n\r\n![An image showing ](Media/Image1.42.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 1.42: Main Control Panel Access Log Settings\r\n\r\n### RadiantOne Logs and Error Messages to Monitor\r\n\r\nThe most important logs to monitor for RadiantOne are vds_server.log and vds_server_access.log. The log files can be viewed and downloaded from Server Control Panel > Log Viewer: You can monitor these logs for the following errors.\r\n\r\nvds_server_access.log\r\n\r\n- SearchResult {resultCode=53\r\n- VDS_Server is shutting-down [Connection to ZooKeeper lost.]\r\n- !!! Server Busy -- Maxmium TCP/IP connection limit(1000) reached\r\n\r\n<RLI_HOME>/vds_server/logs/vds_server.log\r\n\r\nThe following errors indicate the server is shutting down or unable to accept more connections.\r\n\r\n- Server is shutting down: VDS stop command invoked.\r\n- Error in accepting an incoming connection: java.io.IOException: Too many open files\r\n\r\nThe following errors can indicate users are connecting to the server and attempting to perform\r\noperations they are not authorized to.\r\n\r\n- ??? Error in binding: Failed in passing security check point: IP address where the\r\nROOT_USER connected from is not listed.\r\n- SearchResult {resultCode=50\r\n\r\nThe following errors indicate memory problems.\r\n\r\n- java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread\r\n- java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded\r\n- Root exception is java.net.SocketException: Too many open files\r\n\r\nThe following error indicates problems with ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\n- Server is shutting down: VDS has been configured to stop if the connection to ZK is\r\nnot writable any more.\r\n- VDS_Server is shutting-down [Connection to ZooKeeper lost.]\r\n- ConnectionStateListener: ZK connection is not writable any more.\r\n- ZooKeeper session has been lost. [vds_server]\r\n\r\n### Periodic Persistent Cache Refresh Threshold Failures\r\n\r\nTo monitor periodic persistent cache refresh failures due to thresholds being reached, monitor\r\nthe periodiccache.log for keywords: “Threshold reached”. \r\n\r\nThe periodiccache.log file can be viewed and downloaded from Server Control Panel > Log Viewer.\r\n\r\nFor example, assume a 50% Add Threshold has been configured and during the next refresh cycle, there are 85% more entries in the backend than there are in the persistent cache image.\r\nThis persistent cache refresh is aborted, and the following message can be found in the\r\nperiodiccache.log.\r\n\r\n2021 - 04 - 20T11:44:59,487 ERROR - [Storage Periodic Refresh - o=sql] Refresh failed:\r\njava.lang.Exception: Threshold reached with 85% difference for adds.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, a periodic persistent cache refresh is configured on the o=sql naming context.\r\n\r\n### ZooKeeper Logs and Error Messages to Monitor\r\n\r\nThe most important log to monitor for ZooKeeper is zookeeper.log. This log file can be viewed and downloaded from Server Control Panel > Log Viewer. The following are critical error messages to monitor in this log:\r\n\r\n- ERROR [ConnectionStateManager-0:ZooManager@?] - Connection lost. (local zookeeper node no longer able to contact peers in ensemble)\r\n- Non-optimial configuration, consider an odd number of servers.\r\n- Could not add appenderMBean for [null]\r\n- Unexpected exception causing shutdown while sock still open\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n### RadiantOne Activity – Check/Parse Access Log (CSV Format) Output\r\n\r\nBy default, CSV logging is enabled in the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Log > Access Logs settings. On the right, check the CSV option in Output format and click Save.\r\n\r\n![An image showing ](Media/Image1.52.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 1.52: Enabling CSV Log\r\n\r\nFor details on the columns in the CSV file, please see the RadiantOne Logging and Troubleshooting Guide.\r\n\r\n### RadiantOne Activity – Read Changes from a Database Table\r\n\r\nThe RadiantOne service logs all access to data in the vds_server_access.log by default as long as the server log level is set to a minimum of ACCESS. This includes who accessed the data, when (day and time) and what operations they performed. <!--This information can also be logged into a database which allows for third-party reporting tools to easily create meaningful charts and graphs for compliance analysis. Logging to a database requires the [CSV log format output](#radiantone-activity--checkparse-access-log-csv-format-output) enabled and running the Log2DB utility.\r\n\r\nThe database that houses the table which contains the log contents can be in any database server you choose. These settings are located on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Reporting section > Log2DB Settings sub-section. The database associated with the “Database\r\nDatasource” configured here must be running and accessible. To check which database this\r\ndata source points to, navigate to the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Server Backend > DB Data Sources.\r\n\r\n>[!note] \r\n>The default settings leverage a Derby database that is included with RadiantOne and can be started with <RLI_HOME>/bin/DerbyServer.exe.\r\n\r\nOnce RadiantOne is configured to log to CSV and the database hosting the log contents is running, launch the Log2DB utility which is in charge of reading the CSV contents and writing into your database table (table name configured in the Log2db Settings).\r\n\r\n>[!warning] If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, the Log2DB utility must be running on each node.\r\n\r\nDetails about configuring and starting the Log2DB utility and the database columns (describing the log contents) can be found in the Logging and Troubleshooting Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Check/Parse Alert File (CSV Format) Output or Emails Generated from Alerts enabled in Main Control Panel \r\n\r\nOutput options and configuration are described in [Alerts](/alerts-settings/#alerts).\r\n\r\n","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"monitoring-overview"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Monitoring Overview"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Monitoring is one of the most important aspects of maintaining the health of RadiantOne.
