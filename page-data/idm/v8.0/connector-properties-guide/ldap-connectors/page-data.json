These connector types are described in this document.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ldap-changelog-connector\">LDAP (Changelog) connector</h2>\n<p>Any LDAP directory that offers a changelog can use the LDAP connector type. This includes the RadiantOne service.</p>\n<p>For the changelog functionality, some directories like Oracle ODSEE, must have the changelog and retro changelog plug-in enabled. The connector polls the changelog based on the changelog polling interval parameter. The connector internally keeps track of the last processed change and only processes new changes. If the connector is shut down (either deliberately or due to failure) it can read the changelog and capture all changes that occurred while the connector was offline.</p>\n<p>A special user (that represents the \"connector\" user) must exist in the directory. This user must have sufficient rights for detecting changes (reading the changelog). When defining the data source associated with the LDAP (source) backend, enter this user in the connection parameter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ldap-persistent-search-connector\">LDAP Persistent Search connector</h2>\n<p>The Persistent Search connector issues a persistent search and gets notified by the directory server when data changes. For directories that offer persistent search, no special configuration is required to enable this function on the LDAP server. If the connector is shut down (either deliberately or due to failure), the delete operations that occurred on the directory are lost. Once the connector is back online there is no way to retrieve the delete operations that occurred while it was down. The only exception to this is for IBM TDS directories. It stores deleted entries and the capture connector is able to read them, and based on timestamp, determine if the change occurred while the connector was offline.</p>\n<p>Any LDAP directory that offers a persistent search mechanism can use the Persistent Search connector type. Novell eDirectory is an example of an LDAP source that supports persistent search. Others include Red Hat Directory, IBM TDS, and CA Directory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ldap-connector-failover\">LDAP connector failover</h2>\n<p>The LDAP connectors can leverage a failover backend that has been configured for the data source. When you configure a data source for your backend directory, indicate one or more failover servers. An example is shown below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1034px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 65.45454545454545%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"A list of two indicated Failover LDAP Servers in LDAP Data Sources configuration\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/58bdf3f3b910422d0aecbf2f6f5a0c7a/b69f7/image7.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/58bdf3f3b910422d0aecbf2f6f5a0c7a/88b8e/image7.png 275w,\n/static/58bdf3f3b910422d0aecbf2f6f5a0c7a/8c3ad/image7.png 550w,\n/static/58bdf3f3b910422d0aecbf2f6f5a0c7a/b69f7/image7.png 1034w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1034px) 100vw, 1034px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>If a connection cannot be made to the primary server, after the maximum number of retries is exhausted, the connector connects to the failover server.</p>\n<p>This failover mechanism is supported for OpenDJ, Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition (Sun Directory), Oracle Unified Directory (OUD), Novell eDirectory, IBM Tivoli Directory (TDS), CA Directory, Red Hat Directory, and RadiantOne Universal Directory.

For properties common to all connectors, see <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#common-properties-for-all-connectors\">Configure capture connector types and properties</a>. The general properties for LDAP connectors are configured in the Core Properties section. Properties related to filtering of events are configured in the Event Filtering section. Properties related to the contents of the messages published by the connector are configured in the <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#event-contents\">Event Content</a> section. All other properties are configured in the Advanced Properties section. <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#polling-interval\">Polling interval</a> is not required for the LDAP Persistent Search connector. For properties that determine how the connector filters events that are not needed, configure the LDAP Filter, Included Branches and Excluded Branches in the Event Filtering section. These properties are described below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ldap-filter\">LDAP Filter</h3>\n<p>To further condition the entries that are published, you can indicate the desired criteria in the LDAP Filter property. This is a post filter, used to qualify which entries are published by the connector. You must enter a valid LDAP filter in the property.</p>\n<p>This property can be used to avoid publishing unwanted information.</p>\n<p>If a captured entry matches the criteria indicated in the LDAP filter property, it is published by the connector. If it does not, the entry is not published.</p>\n<p>If the captured change type is delete, and not enough information is known about the entry, the LDAP filter is not used and the entry is published by the connector. For example, if the LDAP filter property contained a value of <code class=\"language-text\">(l=Novato)</code> and the captured entry did not contain an <code class=\"language-text\">l</code> attribute, the LDAP filter is not applied and the entry is published.</p>\n<p>If the captured change type is not delete (e.g. insert, update, move, etc.), and not enough information is known about the entry, the LDAP filter is still used and the entry is not published. For example, if the LDAP filter property contained a value of <code class=\"language-text\">(l=Novato)</code> and the captured entry did not contain an <code class=\"language-text\">l</code> attribute, the LDAP filter is still applied and the entry is not published by the connector.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nIf a change is made to this property while the connector is running, it must be restarted for the new value to take effect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"excluded-branches\">Excluded Branches</h3>\n<p>To further condition the entries that are published, you can indicate one or more branches to exclude.

You can set the value to less than <code class=\"language-text\">4</code>, but attempting to connect back to the primary server can be time consuming and therefore not recommended to do frequently.

Since this process is inexact, and changenumber sequence can vary across some replica servers, some events may be replayed or lost. The changelog connector maintains a cursor that indicates information related to the last change processed by the connector along with information about possible replica servers in case failover is needed. During failover, the connector searches the changelog of the replica servers and determines minimum and maximum changenumbers across them. Assume that the last processed changenumber stored by the connector is 100 and there are 2 replica servers defined for the backend. During failover, the connector determines the current changenumbers for each of the replicas by searching their changelogs. Assume that replica 1 has changenumber 99 and replica 2 has changenumber 97. When the connector needs to failover, it must decide whether to start processing changes using changenumber 100 (its current last processed change), 97 (changenumber from replica 2), or 99 (changenumber from replica 1).</p>\n<p>The Failover Algorithm property allows you to determine how the cursor value gets set during failover, and ultimately determine the quantity of events that are replayed. The property supports values between <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">4</code>. The meaning of each is outlined in the table below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 518px; display:inline-block; width: 518px; pointer-events:none; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 8.363636363636363%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAP0lEQVR42oWL2w3AMAjEsv+wbanIBcIrTNBa92OdPF7GQ/MivokZ2ppVW8VsR2R8MiAdrN6ELjGGVJa795d/HNrJdYQz2ss2AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"The Failover Algorithm property with a value set to 1\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/e361be8e1fea46d9bf247b6a241acd8b/2f227/image12.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e361be8e1fea46d9bf247b6a241acd8b/88b8e/image12.png 275w,\n/static/e361be8e1fea46d9bf247b6a241acd8b/2f227/image12.png 518w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Function</th>\n<th>Set this value if...</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Sets cursor to the minimum changenumber based on the current changelog numbers of the replica servers.
