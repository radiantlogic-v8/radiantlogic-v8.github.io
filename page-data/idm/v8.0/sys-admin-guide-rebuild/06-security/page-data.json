This process is called a “bind” operation and means, the client must tell the LDAP server who is going to be accessing the data so that the server can decide what the client is allowed to see and do (authorization). After the client successfully authenticates, RadiantOne checks whether the client is allowed to perform subsequent requests. This process is called authorization and is enforced via <a href=\"#access-control\">access controls</a>.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne supports three types of authentication: anonymous, simple and SASL.</p>\n<p><strong>Anonymous:</strong></p>\n<p>Clients that send an LDAP request without doing a \"bind\" are treated as anonymous. Clients who bind to RadiantOne without a password value are also considered anonymous.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple:</strong></p>\n<p>Simple authentication consists of sending the LDAP server the fully qualified DN of the client (user) and the client's clear-text password. To avoid exposing the password in clear over the network, you can use SSL (an encrypted channel).

The SASL EXTERNAL mechanism is supported by default, but you must configure the [Client Certificate to DN Mapping](#client-certificate-dn-mapping) so the RadiantOne service knows how to identify the user in the certificate to a user in the RadiantOne namespace.

The certificate also associates the entity with a public key.\r\n\r\nFor normal SSL communications, where the only requirement is that the client trusts the server, no additional configuration is necessary (if both entities trust each other). For mutual authentication, where there is a reciprocal trust relationship between the client and the server, the client must generate a certificate containing his identity and private key in his keystore. The client must also make a version of the certificate containing his identity and public key, which RadiantOne must store in its truststore. In turn, the client needs to trust the server; this is accomplished by importing the server's CA certificate into the client truststore.\r\n\r\n>[!note] \r\n>Certificate-based authentication (mutual authentication) requires the use of SSL or StartTLS for the communication between the client and RadiantOne.\r\n\r\nThe diagram below shows how certificates and the SSL protocol are used together for authentication.\r\n\r\n![An image showing ](Media/Image3.82.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Mutual Authentication\r\n\r\nThere are three options for mutual authentication and this can be set from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL > Mutual Auth. Client Certificate drop-down menu: Required, Requested and None (default value). If mutual authentication is required, choose the Required option. If this option is selected, it forces a mutual authentication. If the client fails to provide a valid certificate which can be trusted by RadiantOne, authentication fails, and the TCP/IP connection is dropped.\r\n\r\nIf mutual authentication is not required, but you would like RadiantOne to request a certificate from the client, choose the Requested option. In this scenario, if the client provides a valid/trusted certificate, a mutual authentication connection is established. If the certificate presented is invalid, the authentication fails. If no certificate is presented, the connection continues (using a simple LDAP bind) but is not mutual authentication.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want RadiantOne to request a client certificate at all, check the None option.\r\n\r\nIf the client certificate is not signed by a known certificate authority, it must be added in the [RadiantOne client truststore](#client-certificate-trust-store-cluster-level-trust-store).\r\n\r\n#### Requiring Certificate-based Authentication\r\n\r\nIf you want to require certificate-based authentication:\r\n\r\n1. The client must trust the RadiantOne server certificate (import the RadiantOne public key certificate into the client truststore, unless the server certificate has been signed by a certificate authority known/trusted by the client).\r\n\r\n2. The RadiantOne service must trust the client (import the client’s public key certificate into the [RadiantOne client truststore](#client-certificate-trust-store-cluster-level-trust-store), unless the client certificate is signed by a known/trusted certificate authority).\r\n\r\n3. From the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL > Mutual Auth. Client Certificate drop-down menu, select Required.\r\n\r\n4. From the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL, click **Change** next to [Client Certificate DN Mapping](#client-certificate-dn-mapping) and define your mappings.\r\n\r\n>[!warning] \r\n>The Client Certificate DN Mapping is only accessible by a member of the [Directory Administrator role/group](01-introduction#delegated-administration-of-radiantone).\r\n\r\n5. Click **Save** and restart the RadiantOne service. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, restart RadiantOne on all nodes.\r\n\r\n### Client Certificate DN Mapping\r\n\r\nTo authorize a user who authenticates using a certificate (e.g. SASL External) you must set a client certificate DN mapping. This maps the user DN (Subject or Subject Alternate Name from the certificate) to a specific DN in the RadiantOne namespace. After, the DN in the RadiantOne namespace determines authorization (access controls). \r\n\r\n>[!note] \r\n>To avoid problems with special characters, RadiantOne normalizes the certificate subject prior to applying the certificate DN mapping.\r\n\r\nTo set the client certificate DN mapping:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > SSL sub-section.\r\n\r\n2. Click **Change** next to the Client Certificate DN Mapping property.\r\n\r\n>[!warning] \r\n>The Client Certificate DN Mapping is only accessible by a member of the [Directory Administrator role/group](01-introduction#delegated-administration-of-radiantone).\r\n\r\nThere are different ways to determine the DN from the subject or subject alternative name in the certificate (using regular expression syntax).\r\n\r\nSetting a specific subject or subject alternative name to DN in the virtual namespace:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncn=lcallahan,dc=rli,dc=com (the user DN in the certificate) -> (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the subject or subject alternative name received in the certificate:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuid=(.+),dc=rli,dc=com -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf RadiantOne received a certificate subject of uid=lcallahan,dc=rli,dc=com then it would look for the virtual entry based on:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, authorization would be based on the user DN that is returned.\r\n\r\nAs another option, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the previous example). Let’s take a look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncn=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=com -> (maps to) ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=$1)(dc=$3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf RadiantOne received a subject from the certificate that looked like: cn=laura_callahan,dc=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com, the search that would be issued would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))\r\n```\r\n\r\nRadiantOne uses the DN returned in the search result to base authorization on. \r\n\r\nIf the subject in the SSL certificate is blank, you can specify that a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) should be used. You can use an alternative name in the mapping by specifying {alt} before the regular expression. For example: {alt}^(.+)$ uses the first alternative name found. You can be more specific and specify which alternative name in the certificate that you want to match by specifying the type [0-8]. For example: {alt:0}^(.+)$ uses the otherName alternative name. The type number associated with each is shown below.\r\n\r\notherName                         [0]\r\nrfc822Name                       [1]\r\ndNSName                          [2]\r\nx400Address                      [3]\r\ndirectoryName                   [4]\r\nediPartyName                    [5]\r\nuniformResourceIdentifier  [6]\r\niPAddress                           [7]\r\nregisteredID                        [8]\r\n\r\nFor example, {alt:0}^(.+)@my.gov$ defined as the Certificate DN captures \"james.newt\" for the certificate shown below.\r\n\r\n![Example SSL Certificate](Media/Image3.83.jpg)\r\n \r\nFigure 2: Example SSL Certificate\r\n\r\nIf all mapping rules fail to locate a user, anonymous access is granted (if anonymous access is allowed to RadiantOne).\r\n\r\n>[!note] \r\n>As an alternative to anonymous access, it is generally recommended that you create a final mapping that results in associating the authenticated user with a default user that has minimum access rights. An example is shown below where the last mapping rule matches to a user identified in RadiantOne as “uid=default,ou=globalusers,cn=config”.\r\n\r\n![Example Default Mapping Rule](Media/Image3.84.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Example Default Mapping Rule\r\n\r\n**Processing Multiple Mapping Rules**\r\n\r\nMany Client Certificate DN Mapping rules can be configured. They are processed by RadiantOne in the order they appear.\r\n\r\nThe first DN mapping rule in the list is applied first. IF the user is found with the first mapping rule, then no other rules are evaluated. ONLY if the user is NOT found using the first DN mapping rule will the other rules be evaluated. If all mapping rules fail to locate a user, anonymous access is granted (if anonymous access is allowed to RadiantOne).\r\n\r\nFor example, let’s say two DN Mapping rules have been configured:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)\r\nuid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first DN Mapping rule will be evaluated like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=laura_callahan)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf Laura Callahan’s entry is found from the search, authorization is based on this user DN (and the groups this user is a member of). If the account is not found, then the second mapping rule is evaluated. If all mapping rules fail to locate a user in the virtual namespace, the user who authenticated with the certificate is considered anonymous.\r\n\r\nOnly when the first DN mapping rule fails to find a user will the other DN mapping rules be used.\r\n\r\nRemember, changing any parameters related to SSL requires a restart of the RadiantOne service.\r\n\r\n### Client Certificates (Default Java Truststore)\r\n\r\nFor RadiantOne to connect via SSL to an underlying data source, or accept client certificates for authentication, the appropriate client certificate needs imported (unless they are signed by a trusted/known Certificate Authority). For classic RadiantOne architectures (active/active or active/passive), these certificates can be imported into the default Java trust store (<RLI_HOME>\\jdk\\jre\\lib\\security\\cacerts). \r\n\r\n>[!warning] \r\n>If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, import the client certificates into the [cluster level truststore](client-certificate-trust-store#client-certificate-trust-store-cluster-level-trust-store) instead of the default one so they can be dynamically shared across all cluster nodes.\r\n\r\nTo manage the client certificates contained in the default Java trust store, click **Manage** next to the Client Certificates property.\r\n\r\n![Managing Client Certificates in the Default Java Truststore](Media/Image3.85.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Managing Client Certificates in the Default Java Truststore\r\n\r\n**Viewing Client Certificates**\r\n\r\nTo view a certificate, select the certificate in the list and click **View Certificate**. Valuable information about the certificate is shown (who issued the certificate, who the certificate was issued to, when the certificate is set to expire, status…etc.). From this location, you have the option to copy the certificate to a file.\r\n\r\n**Adding Client Certificates**\r\n\r\nTo add a certificate:\r\n\r\n1. Click **Add Certificate**. \r\n\r\n2. Browse to the location of the client certificate file and click **OK**. \r\n\r\n3. Click **Add Certificate**. \r\n\r\n4. Enter a short, unique name (alias) for the certificate and click **OK**. \r\n\r\n5. Enter the Key Store Password and click **OK**. The default password is changeit.The added certificate appears in the list.\r\n\r\n6. Click **Save** in the upper right corner.\r\n\r\n7. Restart the RadiantOne service.\r\n\r\n**Deleting Client Certificates**\r\n\r\nTo delete a certificate:\r\n\r\n1. Select the desired certificate and click **Delete Certificate**.\r\n\r\n2. Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.\r\n\r\n3. Click **Save** in the upper right corner.\r\n\r\n4. Restart the RadiantOne service.\r\n\r\n**Set Key Store Password**\r\n\r\nTo change the Key Store password (which by default is changeit):\r\n\r\n1. Click **Set Password**.\r\n\r\n2. Enter the old password, new password, and confirm the new password. Click **OK**.\r\n\r\n3.

If enabled, the filter keeps track of the number of requests per second from a connection. If a limit is exceeded, the request is either rejected, delayed, or throttled.</p>\n<p>Requests in excess of the per-second limit are throttled by being queued for delayed processing, and eventually rejected altogether if they continue to accumulate.  An unthrottled request is processed immediately without intervention by the filter.</p>\n<p>To enable DoS filtering:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the Main Control Panel, navigate to Settings > Security > DoS Filter.

It provides assurance that the entity claiming a particular identity, is the entity to which that identity was assigned. There are 5 levels of assurance used by RadiantOne to enforce access controls to data. The default level is no enforcement of assurance (Level 0). You can use this level when there is minimum risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data. \r\n\r\nLevel 1 indicates an authentication method of basic credentials (username+password) is required to access the data. At this level, there is little confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is low risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data. \r\n\r\nLevel 2 indicates an authentication method of Kerberos (leveraging GSSAPI) is required to access the data. At this level, there is some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is moderate risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.\r\n\r\n>[!warning] \r\n>Ensure you have RadiantOne configured properly as a [Kerberos LDAP service](security#kerberos).\r\n\r\nLevel 3 indicates multi-factor authentication (e.g. RSA SecurID token code, Yubikey) is required to access the data. At this level, there is high confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is high risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data. \r\n\r\n\r\n>[!warning] \r\n>Ensure you have RadiantOne configured properly with a [Custom Authentication Provider](interception#custom-authentication-providers).\r\n\r\nLevel 4 indicates certificate-based (mutual) authentication is required to access the data. There is very high confidence in an asserted identity of the entity. This is the highest level of authentication assurance and should be used when there is very high risk associated with accessing the data.\r\n\r\n>[!warning] \r\n>Ensure you have RadiantOne configured properly for [Mutual Authentication](server-backend#mutual-authentication).\r\n\r\nSelect the assurance level from the drop-down list and select an operator.

You can allow or deny all operations, or you can assign one or more of the following:</p>\n<p><strong>All</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates that the subject has the following rights to the targeted entry: read, write, search, delete, compare, and selfwrite. The All access right does not give the following rights to the target entry: proxy.</p>\n<p>Example of syntax when all operations are selected:</p>\n<p>(targetattr = \"homePhone\")(target = \"ldap:///dv=address book,o=vds\")(targetfilter = \"(securitylevel=secret)\")(targetscope = \"subtree\")(version 3.0;acl \"myaci\";allow (all) (userdn = \"ldap:///all\");)</p>\n<p><strong>Read</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can read the directory entries and the attributes of entries specified in the ACI. This permission applies only to the search operation.</p>\n<p><strong>Search</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can search on the targets specified in the ACI. This permission applies only to the search operation. The Search right is checked once, and after the search is allowed or denied, it is not checked again. If the search is allowed, the read right is then applied to each entry to be returned as a result of the search and to each attribute of each entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Add</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can create entries.</p>\n<p><strong>Delete</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can delete entries.</p>\n<p><strong>Compare</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can compare data they supply in the request with data stored in the directory. With compare rights, the directory returns a success or failure message in response to an inquiry, but the user cannot see the value of the entry or attribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Write</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can modify an entry by adding, modifying, or deleting attributes. This permission applies to the modify and modRDN operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Self Write</strong></p>\n<p>Indicates whether users can add or delete their own DN in an attribute of the target group entry. The syntax of this attribute must be a distinguished name. This right is used only for group management. Self write works with proxy authorization: it grants the right to add or delete the proxy DN from the group entry (not the DN of the user from the Bind operation).</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy</strong></p>\n<p>Authorization for RadiantOne data is checked based on the user who authenticated. The authorization ID (DN) is linked to the authenticated ID (DN) for the same connection. With the proxy authorization control enabled, the client can switch the user ID (for authorization purposes) without having to re-authenticate with a new connection.</p>\n<p>If there is the need to base authorization on a different user than the one who authenticated, you can use the proxy authorization control. This is primarily useful in environments where an application must authenticate many users and doesn’t want to maintain an open connection to RadiantOne for each of them. With this approach, the application can authenticate the user, and after, impersonate that user for authorization purposes. The application can use its own service account when connecting to RadiantOne and pass the needed control along with the user DN of the person they want to represent for authorization in their requests. RadiantOne then checks the proxy authorization rules that have been configured in access controls to make sure the service account is allowed to represent the person passed in their request. If so, the service account is allowed to perform any operations the person they are impersonating would be allowed to do.</p>\n<p>The proxy option indicates whether the subject can access the target with the rights of another entry. You can grant proxy access using the DN of any user in the directory except the special cn=directory manager user. In addition, you cannot grant proxy rights to the cn=directory manager user. If the branch you are protecting with access controls is a local LDAP/HDAP store, then this requires the <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#proxied-authorization-control\">Proxy Authorization control</a> enabled for RadiantOne.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subjects\">Subjects</h3>\n<p>A subject is whom the access control rule applies to. The subject types that can be associated with access control rules are described below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIt is recommended to define access controls on subjects that are located in a RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) store or persistent cache. This prevents possible performance or network issues involved with RadiantOne connecting to a backend directory in order to enforce authorization. If your ACI’s require subjects that are located in backend directories, make sure that the backend is configured for high availability and that the <a href=\"02-concepts#data-source\">RadiantOne data source</a> is configured with the failover servers appropriately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Users – applicable to any specific user(s).</li>\n<li>Groups – applicable to a group of users. If the group is a nested group in HDAP, enable Main Control Panel > Settings > Security > Access Control > <a href=\"06-security#enable-nested-groups\">Enable Nested Groups</a> and configure <a href=\"05-creating-virtual-views#linked-attributes\">Linked Attribute</a> settings from Main Control Panel > Settings > Interception > Special Attributes Handling.</li>\n<li>Tree Branch - Applicable to the DN specified as part of the subject and all entries below it in the virtual directory tree. The defined access permissions apply to any user found in the tree branch you choose.</li>\n<li>Group Owner - applicable to the owner, manager, or role of the group. You can define the target, scope, attributes and permissions using the Control Panel and then select this ACI and click Manual Edit to refine the subject for this complex scenario. See below for an example:<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>(targetattr=\"*\")(target=\"ldap:///o=My Company?manager,owner,role\")(targetscope = \"subtree\")(version 3.0;acl \"Group owner access only\";allow (all)(userdn = \"ldap:///self\");)<br>\r\nThe above ACI will dictate that: if the binding user is the \"manager\", or the \"owner\", or bearing the \"role\" of the targeted entity, then the binding user has the access to targeted entry; otherwise, the access is denied.<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Public – anyone connected to the directory is considered public. This also includes anonymous users.</li>\n<li>Self – applicable to the user whose authenticated DN matches the DN of the entry that is being accessed.</li>\n<li>Authenticated – applicable to any user who successfully authenticates.</li>\n<li>Parent – applicable to the entry only if their bind DN is the parent of the targeted entry. For example, to allow users to modify any child entries of their bind DN, create the following ACI on the dv=address book,o=vds node:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(targetattr = \"*\")(target = \"ldap:///dv=address book,o=vds\")(targetscope = \"subtree\")(version 3.0;acl \"myaci\";allow (write) (userdn = \"ldap:///parent\");)</p>\n<!--\r\n\r\nYou can indicate that a client connection must originate from a single IP address or a range of addresses. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported and you can indicate a range of IP addresses using “/”. A mix of IPv4 and IPv6 can also be used. See below for examples:\r\n\r\n**Single IPv4 address**\r\n<br>10.11.12.129\r\n\r\n**Single IPv6 address**\r\n<br>fe80::b010:e554:f9d5:dec0%10\r\n**Range of IPv4 addresses (use the “/”) like:**\r\n<br>10.11.12.0/24 which represents the given IPv4 address and its associated routing prefix 10.11.12.0, or equivalently, its subnet mask 255.255.255.0, which has 24 leading 1-bits. This covers the range between 10.11.12.0 to 10.11.12.255.\t\r\n**Range of IPv6 addresses:**\r\n<br>2001:db8::/32 which covers the range between 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:0 to 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff\r\n\r\nFor IPv6 addresses, use the syntax defined by RFC 2373. For example, 0:0:0:0:0:0:13.1.68.3 which can also be expressed as ::13.1.68.3 are both valid forms of IPv6 addresses. An address with a subnet prefix length can also be used (e.g. 12AB::CD30:0:0:0:0/60). Wildcards cannot be used in IPv6 addresses.\r\n\r\n>[!note] \r\n\r\nTo use DNS addresses, manually edit the ACI after saving it by clicking **Manually Edit**. Use the keyword dns and enter the fully qualified DNS domain name. Use an operator of either “equal to” (=) or “not equal to” (!=). Wildcards are supported in the DNS address.\r\n\r\n-->\n<h2 id=\"aci-evaluation-rules\">ACI Evaluation Rules</h2>\n<p>The ACI evaluation rules that RadiantOne follows are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When the RadiantOne service starts, all ACIs defined in the entries below \"ou=aggregate,ou=globalaci,cn=config\" are loaded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To determine if an operation is allowed or denied, RadiantOne looks in the ACI list for the target of the operation to collect all target-matched aci values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne separates the aci values into two lists; one list contains all the aci values that match the target and denies the required access, and the other list contains all the aci values that match the target and allows the required access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the deny list contains any aci values after this procedure, access is immediately denied.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the deny list is empty, then the allow list is processed. If the allow list contains any aci values, access is allowed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If both lists are empty, access is denied.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] To troubleshoot/trace ACI evaluation decisions, <a href=\"09-logs#log-settings\">RadiantOne server log level</a> must be set to DEBUG.

Enter a policy name applicable to the intended usage and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>\n<p>The ‘Subject’ of the custom policy can be either Sub-tree or Group and is based on a specific base DN. Click <strong>CHOOSE</strong> to select a base DN. If the subject is set to sub-tree, this means that all user entries below the chosen base DN (which must be a RadiantOne Universal Directory store or persistent cache) are affected by the custom policy. If the subject is set to group, this means that all users that are a member of the group specified in the base DN are affected by the custom policy. The group DN can represent a static group (unique members listed in the group entry) or a dynamic group (associated with the groupOfURLs object class and contains a memberURL attribute dictating the members). RadiantOne evaluates dynamic membership automatically to enforce password policies. If a user is affected by a policy defined for sub-tree and for group, the one associated with the group takes precedence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Custom policy properties override those defined in the default policy. The only exception is the password content properties where you can choose to enable the enforcement of the custom policy, or choose to use the default policy. Keep in mind that a value of 0 (zero) in a custom policy for password content means an unlimited amount is allowed. It does not mean that it is undefined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An example of a custom password policy is shown below. It is applicable to all users who are located in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store and are a member of the Special Users group identified in the DIT as cn=special users,ou=globalgroups,cn=config.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] If you define multiple custom password policies associated with groups (as the Subject), they should not have the same precedence if they share members. If a user is affected by multiple group-based policies, the one with the highest precedence (lowest numeric value in the precedence setting) is enforced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 32%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Example Custom Password Policy Applicable to a Group\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/b966c/Image3.104.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/c1cfe/Image3.104.jpg 275w,\n/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/67061/Image3.104.jpg 550w,\n/static/4f8a3f396985045d8a5f6ed4137e6a38/b966c/Image3.104.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 21: Example Custom Password Policy Applicable to a Group</p>\n<p>An example of a custom password policy applicable to all users below a specific container is shown below.

From the Main Control Panel, you can indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). A value of 1d 5h 45m would indicate a password expires after 1 day, 5 hours and 45 minutes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Your password policy must uphold the following rule: pwdMinAge + pwdExpireWarning &#x3C; pwdMaxAge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If a user’s password is expired, the next time a client (on the user’s behalf) connects to RadiantOne, the bind will fail and the additional information returned to the client indicates the password has expired. An example using an ldapsearch command line client by a user identified as “tuser” is shown below.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ldapsearch -h 10.11.12.164 -p 2389 -D \"uid=tuser,ou=people,o=global\" -w password -b \"o=global\" \"(uid=tuser)\"</code>\r\n<br><code class=\"language-text\">ldap_simple_bind: Invalid credentials</code>\r\n<br><code class=\"language-text\">ldap_simple_bind: additional info: Password has expired.</code></p>\n<p>During the bind, RadiantOne calculates if the user’s password has expired and returns the bind response and additional information to the client. It is up to the client to prompt the user to reset their password, if this functionality is desired.</p>\n<p>The user entry stored in RadiantOne doesn’t contain an attribute that indicates a user’s password has expired. However, the entry contains an attribute (passwordExpWarned) indicating when the password expiring warning was send in the bind response.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">dn: uid=tuser,ou=people,o=global</code>\r\n<br><code class=\"language-text\">passwordExpWarned: 20170622194148.238Z</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"send-a-warning-before-the-password-expires\">Send a warning before the password expires</h3>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdExpireWarning attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. It contains the amount of time before a password is due to expire in which case an expiration warning message is returned to an authenticating user. From the Main Control Panel, you can indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). A value of 1d would indicate a password expiration warning should be sent 1 day prior to the password expiring.</p>\n<p>If this attribute is not present, or if the value is 0d no warnings are returned. If not 0d, the value must be smaller than the value of the pwdMaxAge attribute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Your password policy must uphold the following rule: pwdMinAge + pwdExpireWarning &#x3C; pwdMaxAge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When this is configured, a control is returned with the BindResponse (even if the client doesn’t specifically request it) indicating the amount of time until expiration. An example is shown below.</p>\n<p>PasswordExpiringControl {2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.5 false secondsUntilExpiration=432000}</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-a-certain-number-of-login-attempts-after-the-password-expires\">Allow a certain number of login attempts after the password expires</h3>\n<p>These are known as grace logins. The value of this parameter is stored in the pwdGraceAuthNLimit attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. The parameter specifies the number of times an expired password can be used to authenticate. If this attribute is not present, or if the value is 0, authentication fails if the password has expired.</p>\n<p>During the grace login attempts, bind requests are processed. However, the subsequent operation after the bind must be a modifyRequest to change the password. Otherwise, an error message is returned indicating “You must change your password before submitting any other requests”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"password-content\">Password Content</h2>\n<p>The following are the password content options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Password minimum length</li>\n<li>Minimum required digit (0-9) characters</li>\n<li>Minimum required uppercase (A-Z) characters</li>\n<li>Minimum required lowercase (a-z) characters</li>\n<li>Minimum required special characters</li>\n<li>Password encryption</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If more complex password content is required, the Password Strength Rule can be used.</p>\n<p>Each of these properties is described below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 35.63636363636363%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Password Content and Account Lockout Options\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a681d754aea01e2b98388c7f692097cd/b966c/Image3.108.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a681d754aea01e2b98388c7f692097cd/c1cfe/Image3.108.jpg 275w,\n/static/a681d754aea01e2b98388c7f692097cd/67061/Image3.108.jpg 550w,\n/static/a681d754aea01e2b98388c7f692097cd/b966c/Image3.108.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 24: Password Content and Account Lockout Options</p>\n<h3 id=\"enabled\">Enabled</h3>\n<p>This option is only applicable to custom password policies.</p>\n<p>Custom policies can enforce specific password content criteria or inherit from the default policy.

This option requires enabling both “User must change password after reset” and “Require existing password in order to change password” in the Password Change section of the password policy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] This leverages the Damerau Levenshtein algorithm to determine the variation of characters between the old and new passwords.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"restrictions-on-using-accountname-or-username\">Restrictions on Using Accountname or Username</h3>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdEnableNotContainNames attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and has a value of true or false. If true, the user’s password must not contain the user’s accoutname or parts of the user’s full name that exceed two consecutive characters.</p>\n<p>For the accountname value, the sAMAccountname attribute is checked first. If sAMAccountname is not found, the uid attribute is checked. If uid is not found, rdn value is checked. For the user’s full name, the attribute displayName is checked. If displayName is not present, cn is checked. If the cn attribute is not found, the full name is computed (givenName+sn) and checked. These checks are not case-sensitive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"password-encryption\">Password Encryption</h3>\n<p>The passwords that are stored in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store may be hashed using any of the following methods: Clear, CRYPT, MD5, PBKDF2AD, Salted SHA-1, Salted SHA-256, Salted SHA-384, Salted SHA-512, and SHA-1. The least secure methods of CRYPT, MD5, and SHA-1 have been hidden as options from the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] PBKDF2AD is the required password encryption expected in Azure AD. Therefore, if your HDAP store (or persistent cache) will be synchronized to Azure AD, and passwords are a part of the synchronization, use the PBKDF2AD encryption option to store passwords in the RadiantOne Universal Directory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"automatic-update-to-stronger-password-hash\">Automatic Update to Stronger Password Hash</h3>\n<p>If the “Update stored passwords to stronger encryption after successful bind” is enabled, user accounts that contain a password hashed with a less secure method than allowed for the current password policy are automatically updated to the stronger hash after a successful bind. The only exception to this is for passwords that have a current hash of: PKCS5S2, PBKDF2, PBKDF2AD, SCRYPT, BCRYPT, SMD4, or MD4, in which case the hashing is not changed. This value is stored in the pwdEnableAlgorithmUpgrade attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and has a value of True or False.</p>\n<p>The strength order is as follows:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">CLEAR -> CRYPT -> MD5 -> SHA1 -> SSHA1 -> SHA256 -> SSHA256 -> SHA384 -> SSHA384 -> SHA512 -> SSHA512 -> (PKCS5S2 | PBKDF2 | PBKDF2AD | SCRYPT | BCRYPT | SMD4 | MD4)</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] PKCS5S2, PBKDF2, PBKDF2AD, SCRYPT, BCRYPT, SMD4, and MD4 are considered as special hashes of the strongest ranking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"password-strength-rule\">Password Strength Rule</h3>\n<p>The default options for enforcing password content are based on an AND operation. For example, if you set a minimum password length, minimum number of required digits, and a minimum number of required uppercase letters, the rule would be expressed as follows.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;min password length> AND &lt;min # of digits> AND &lt;min # uppercase letters>.</code></p>\n<p>The Password Strength Rule option allows you to define and test password strength requirements that are more complex using an OR condition. For example, you could use the Password Strength Rule option to require a password to have 'n' number of special characters OR 'n' number of Upper Case characters. In another example, a password strength rule requiring at least six total characters, with at least one lower case, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit OR one symbol would be expressed in the Password Strength Rule field as follows.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">^.(?=.{6,})(?=.[a-z])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[\\d\\W]).*$</code></p>\n<p>Another example would be if you do not want to allow special characters to be used in the password. This would be expressed in the Password Strength Rule field as:\r\n<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>+$</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Checking the Password Strength Rule box disables and overrides all other password Content options except Password minimum length and Password encryption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Enter your password strength rule using regular expression syntax.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Test</strong> to compile your expression.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-dictionary-check\">Enable Dictionary Check</h3>\n<p>The Enable Dictionary Check option is comparable to the Strong Password Check plug-in found in legacy LDAP directories. This enables RadiantOne to verify that a user’s password doesn’t contain unallowed strings from a specified dictionary file. This can be used as a method to enforce strong password policies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] The default behavior uses an exact match comparison of the password to a dictionary value. To enforce a contains match comparison, go to the Main Control Panel > Zookeeper tab, navigate to <code class=\"language-text\">/radiantone/&lt;version>/&lt;clusterName>/config/vds_server.conf</code> and click EDIT MODE. Set the following: \"enablePwdPolicyDictionarySubstringCheck\" : true <BR> The value of “true” must be in all lowercase, as shown above. <BR>You can also set this property using the vdsconfig command line utility, set-property command. For details, see the <a href=\"/command-line-configuration-guide/01-introduction\">Radiantone Command Line Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To enable this feature:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From Main Control Panel, navigate to the Settings tab >Security > Password policies section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Locate the Password Content section and check the option to Enable Dictionary Check. This value is stored in the pwdEnableDictionary attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and has a value of True or False.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Browse</strong> to navigate to the dictionary file. The value for the location of the dictionary file is stored in the pwdDictionaryFile attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The dictionary file must be a text-formatted file containing one dictionary word per line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"account-activity-and-lockout\">Account Activity and Lockout</h2>\n<p>Accounts may be automatically locked under two circumstances:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If a user has not authenticated successfully to RadiantOne for longer than a specified period of time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a user has reached the failed login threshold.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"keep-track-of-users-last-successful-login-time\">Keep Track of User’s Last Successful Login Time</h3>\n<p>If you want to keep track of a user’s last successful login time, enable the option to “Keep track of the user’s last successful logon time” in the Account Activity section of the password policy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] You can exclude pwdLastLogonTime changes from the RadiantOne changelog by setting the following property in ZooKeeper at /radiantone/&#x3C;Config_Version>/&#x3C;RadiantOne_ClusterName>/config/vds_server.conf: \"skipLoggingIntoChangelogForPwdLastLogonTime\" : \"true\", <BR> This alleviates excessive writing into the changelog when you have a large volume of user login activity. This property is enforced globally and affects all password policies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can indicate the frequency that RadiantOne records the time of the last successful authentication. The default value is 0s meaning that the last login time is updated on every successful authentication. To change the default, indicate the length of time in any combination of days, hours and/or minutes using “d” for days (e.g. 1d), “h” for hours (e.g. 4h), and “m” for minutes (e.g. 5m). For example, a value of 1d indicates the last login time is updated if at least 1 day has passed since the last successful authentication. Subsequent successful authentications, within this time frame, do not change the last login time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] There is a performance impact on RadiantOne if you keep track of last successful logins because a write operation is performed with a successful bind. It is recommended that you indicate a frequency for writing the last login and that you test the usage of this feature to determine if the degradation in performance is acceptable for your usage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If accounts should be automatically locked when a user has not authenticated successfully for a predetermined amount of time, indicate the threshold (number of days) in the “Account Activity” section of the password policy where you see “Lock user’s account if the user is idle longer than <X> days”. The user’s password must be reset to unlock the account. Once the account is unlocked, if it is not used for login longer than the specified time, the account is locked again. If the value is zero days, this means users will never be locked out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lock-accounts-based-on-number-of-failed-logins\">Lock Accounts Based on Number of Failed Logins</h3>\n<p>If accounts should be locked out after a failed login threshold is met, check the Accounts may be locked out option in the password policy, and establish the criteria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How may login failures are allowed? Enter this value for X (Lockout account after X login failures).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdMaxFailure attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry and contains the number of failed login attempts to allow. This corresponds to the operational attribute for the user entry named pwdFailureTime which stores the time(s) of the login failure(s).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How often to reset the failure count? Enter this value for X (Reset failure count after X minutes).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdFailureCountInterval attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. This is the temporary interval of time in which RadiantOne keeps track of the number of failed login attempts. For example, if the number of login failures allowed is 2 and the reset failure account is 5 minutes, this means if a user login fails twice within 5 minutes, the account will be locked. If the user logs in unsuccessfully once and then doesn’t try again until after the 5-minute interval has passed, the number of unsuccessful login attempts is reset and the new failed login attempt counts as the first failure instead of the second failure. This relates to the number of values for the pwdFailureTime operational attribute in the user’s entry which is used to determine how many failed logins have been attempted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Once an account is locked, the reset failure count is irrelevant in terms of determining how many failed login attempts have occurred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How long is an account locked out?\r\n<br>Lockout forever\r\n<br>Lockout duration X minutes</p>\n<p>This value is stored in the pwdLockoutDuration attribute of the cn=Password Policy entry. This relates to the operational attribute <a href=\"#pwdaccountlockedtime\">pwdAccountLockedTime</a> in the user’s entry which includes a timestamp indicating when the user’s account became locked. Once a lockout duration has passed, or a user’s password has been reset by an administrator, the account is unlocked. Any user (other than the locked out user) that has the proper permissions (ACI’s) can reset the user’s password.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"unlocking-accounts\">Unlocking Accounts</h3>\n<p>If a user’s account is locked, it can become unlocked by resetting the user’s password. Any user (other than the locked out user) that has the proper permissions (ACI’s) can reset the user’s password. If the lockout policy has a duration period, the account is automatically unlocked after the duration has passed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"operational-password-attributes-stored-in-user-entries\">Operational Password Attributes Stored in User Entries</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] Since these attributes are defined as operational attributes, they do not appear in the user entries unless specifically requested in the search from the client.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"pwdhistory\">pwdHistory</h3>\n<p>Stores the previous values used for passwords to prevent users from re-using previous passwords.

RadiantOne does not write to this attribute or allow password policies to be defined on individual users from the Main Control Panel. However, if the entry was imported from another directory, this attribute could have a value that dictates which password policy affects the user. If the value matches a policy defined in RadiantOne, this policy is enforced for the user. If the value does not match a policy defined in RadiantOne it is ignored and other configured policies below cn=Password Policy,cn=config are checked. If multiple policies affect the user, the one with the highest priority (based on precedence level) is enforced.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pwdreset\">pwdReset</h3>\n<p>A Boolean attribute containing the value TRUE if the password has been reset and must be changed by the user. If a user’s password is set/reset by the RadiantOne super user (e.g. cn=directory manager), a member of the cn=directory administrators group (cn=directory administrators,ou=globalgroups,cn=config), or the user himself, this does not trigger pwdReset set to TRUE. Only when a user’s password is set/reset by other users (e.g. helpdesk) is the pwdReset set to TRUE. When the affected user logs in with the new password for the first time, they are not allowed to perform operations until they reset their password. For example, if the user attempts a search, RadiantOne responds with error code 53 and a message indicating “You must change your password before submitting any other requests”. After the user updates their password, pwdReset is removed from their entry.</p>\n<p>If a user resets their password, RadiantOne performs the following checks based on the password policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check if the user is allowed to change their password</li>\n<li>Check minimum password age</li>\n<li>Check if old password is provided with new password (if the “Require Existing Password in order to Change Password” policy is enabled)</li>\n<li>Check the password length</li>\n<li>Check the password quality (correct number of required characters – upper/lower/number…etc.)</li>\n<li>Check if the password is in the history</li>\n<li>Check if the password contains unallowed strings based on a dictionary file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the BIND response is returned, it is up to the client to prompt the user accordingly (depending on what kind of password policy response or control was returned).</p>\n<p>RadiantOne returns one of the following responses to the client application:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Modify Response Code</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>53</td>\n<td>User password changes are not allowed.

This allows for limiting the number of entries LDAP clients can receive from a query. By default this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on the size.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThis parameter is a global parameter for RadiantOne. If you want more granular, specific size limits set, then you should set them in the Custom Limits sections.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"time-limit\">Time Limit</h3>\n<p>The time (in seconds) during which a search operation is expected to finish. If a search operation does not finish within this time parameter, the query is aborted. By default, this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"look-through-limit\">Look Through Limit</h3>\n<p>The look through limit is the maximum number of entries you want the server to check in response to a search request. You should use this value to limit the number of entries the server will look through to find an entry. This limits the processing and time spent by the server to respond to potentially bogus search requests (for example, if a client sends a search filter based on an attribute that is not indexed). By default, this is set to 0, which means that there is no limit set for the number of entries that the server will look through.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThis property is not used by RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) stores.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"idle-timeout\">Idle Timeout</h3>\n<p>The length of time (in seconds) to keep a connection open without any activity from the client. The default is 900, which means the idle connection is kept open for 900 seconds and then closed by the server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"custom-limits\">Custom Limits</h2>\n<p>Custom limits are more fine-grained than global limits and can be defined in the Main Control Panel > Settings > Limits > Custom Limits section. Custom limits can be configured for the pre-defined users: “Anonymous Users”, and “Authenticated Users”. They can also be more granular and associated with users belonging to any group or located below any branch/naming context (subtree) in RadiantOne.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nMultiple custom limits are not allowed for anonymous users and authenticated users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Custom limits override any Global Limits defined in the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Limits section > Global Limits sub-section. The order of precedence (highest to lowest) for global and custom limits containing the same subject is: Group, Sub-tree, Authenticated Users, Anonymous Users, Global. For custom limits defined within the same root naming context, the limit defined for the deepest entry in the tree will take precedence. For example, if a custom size limit of 3 is defined for a subject location of ou=Novato,ou=California,dc=USA and a size limit of 5 is defined for a subject location of ou=California,dc=USA, if a user of uid=Svc1,ou=Novato,ou=California,dc=USA connects to RadiantOne, the custom size limit of 3 will be enforced.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nThis section is accessible only in <a href=\"01-introduction#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"granular-limits\">Granular Limits</h3>\n<p>To define custom limits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>ADD</strong> in the Custom Limits section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select a subject from the drop-down list. The possible subjects are described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sub-tree - the location (base DN) in the RadiantOne namespace containing the users that are affected by the custom limits.</li>\n<li>Group – a group entry in the virtual namespace. All members of this group are affected by the custom limits.</li>\n<li>Anonymous users – any authenticated users or anonymous users.</li>\n<li>Authenticated Users – any authenticated users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>CHOOSE</strong> to browse and select a subject location – if sub-tree is selected, the subject location is the base DN containing the users that are affected by the custom limits. If group is selected, the subject location is the DN of the group entry. All members of this group are affected by the custom limits. If authenticated users or anonymous users are selected, subject location is irrelevant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter a value for maximum connections. This is the maximum number of concurrent connections the subject can create. By default, this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on maximum connections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter a value for size limit. This is the maximum number of entries a search operation can return. This allows for limiting the number of entries LDAP clients can receive from a query. By default, this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on the size.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter a value for idle timeout. This is the length of time (in seconds) to keep a connection open without any activity from the client. By default, this value is set to 0 which means there is no restriction on idle time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The RadiantOne service needs to be restarted.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"number-of-processing-queues\">Number of Processing Queues</h3>\n<p>If you are running RadiantOne on a multi-processor machine, performance and efficiency of the server might improve by increasing the value for the Number of Processing Queues parameter. The default value is 2 and is sufficient for most deployments. As a general guideline, this value should never exceed 3.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThis parameter does not affect the actual number of processors that get used. However, it does improve the utilization of the available processors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A better indicator for performance is the number of threads allocated for each processing queue. For each processing queue, the maximum number of concurrent worker threads is 80 by default. This value can be seen/changed in the Max Concurrent Working Threads parameter. For more details, see the next section.</p>\n<p>After making changes, click <strong>Save</strong>. RadiantOne must be restarted for the changes to take effect. If deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximum-concurrent-working-threads\">Maximum Concurrent Working Threads</h3>\n<p>This is the number of threads the virtual directory server uses for handling client requests. In other words, this defines the number of concurrent LDAP requests RadiantOne can handle. If there are backends involved (e.g. proxy views without persistent cache), then you must also consider how the backend handles the level of concurrency you define here as well because requests made to RadiantOne may directly result in concurrent requests sent to the backend(s).</p>\n<p>The default value is 16, which means 16 worker threads allocated per processing queue defined in the Number of Processing Queues property. This amount is sufficient for most deployments and generally should not be modified unless recommended by Radiant Logic. You might be able to increase this number if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You are using a multiprocessor system - Multiprocessor systems can support larger thread pools than single processor systems. See the Number of Processors parameter above.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clients connecting to RadiantOne perform many time-consuming operations simultaneously (like complex searches or updates).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne needs to support many simultaneous client connections.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is difficult to provide an exact formula for determining the optimal number of maximum concurrent working threads to set because it depends on the machine and environment where RadiantOne is running. Generally, the value for concurrent working threads should not be modified unless recommended by Radiant Logic. If it is modified, you must verify the value you set with testing. Incrementally change the value and retest. In the test results, you should start to see performance peak and then a decrease. The peak in the curve should represent the optimal setting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"max-pending-connection-requests\">Max Pending Connection Requests</h3>\n<p>The max pending connection property represents a queue of server socket connections associated with requests from clients. This is not managed by the RadiantOne process. As soon as a TCP connection is established to RadiantOne, the connection is removed from the pending queue. A maximum number of pending client requests can be set in the Max Pending Connection Requests parameter. This parameter should not be changed unless advised by a Radiant Logic Support Engineer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"access-regulation\">Access Regulation</h2>\n<p>After a client connects to the RadiantOne service, the amount of activity they perform can be limited by configuring access regulation. The activity checking can be performed based on the user that connects to RadiantOne.</p>\n<p>The “Restrictions Checking Interval” parameter indicated in the Per User section is the time frame in which the activity (max binds and max operations) is monitored. Once the time interval is reached, the counts are reset. For example, if Special Users Group checking is enabled, and the checking interval, max bind operations per checking interval and max operations per checking interval are set to 300, 30 and 10 respectively, during a 5 minute (300 secs) period, anyone who is a member of the special users group can bind no more than 30 times to the RadiantOne service and not perform more than 10 operations. This count resets every 5 minutes. If a user attempts to perform more than the allowed number of operations, the RadiantOne service refuses the operation and the client must wait until the checking interval resets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"per-user\">Per User</h3>\n<p>The following groups of users found on the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Limits section > Per User sub-section allow you to configure fine-grained activity control:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nMembers of the Administrators group specified on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Server Front End > Administration section do not have any access limitations in terms of max connections or max operations per second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"anonymous\">Anonymous</h3>\n<p>An anonymous user is a client who connects anonymously (no username or password) to the RadiantOne service. To enable checking for this category of user, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Anonymous section of the Per User Category sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum bind operations that anonymous users are allowed to perform. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authenticated-users\">Authenticated Users</h3>\n<p>An authenticated user encompasses any client who successfully authenticates no matter which group they are a member of. To enable checking for this category of users, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Authenticated Users section of the Per User Category sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum bind operations that authenticated users are allowed to perform. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"special-users-group\">Special Users Group</h3>\n<p>Special Users are anyone who successfully binds and is a member of the special user group defined on the Main Control Panel > Server Front End > Administration section. To enable checking for this category of users, check the Enable Access Checking option in the Special Users Group section in the Per User Category sub-section. Enter a number for the maximum bind operations that users in the Special Users Group are allowed to perform. Also enter a number for the maximum number of operations per checking interval they are allowed to issue. Any parameters that are set to 0 have no limits applied. The restrictions checking interval dictates the number of seconds the server should wait before determining if these thresholds are reached.</p>\n<h1 id=\"access-control\">Access Control</h1>\n<p>The settings found in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Access Control sub-section are for defining access permissions for the virtual namespace.

These settings dictate whether RadiantOne enforces defined access controls, allows anonymous access, requires passwords for bind operations, and if nested groups are supported. Each setting is described in more details below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-aci\">Enable ACI</h3>\n<p>The checking of ACIs by RadiantOne can be enabled or disabled by using the Enable ACI checkbox. Check the box to enable and uncheck to disable. For specific details about setting ACI, please see <a href=\"06-security#security-and-access-controls\">Security and Access Controls</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-anonymous-access\">Allow Anonymous Access</h3>\n<p>If RadiantOne should allow anonymous access, then check the Allow Anonymous Access checkbox. If RadiantOne should not allow anonymous access, uncheck this box. By default, anonymous access is allowed. This is the default global access permission for anonymous users and is enforced before subsequent ACI rules. In other words, even if anonymous access were allowed as a general policy, subsequent ACI rules could prevent anonymous users from accessing any data. For details on access controls that can be set, please <a href=\"06-security#security-and-access-controls\">Security and Access Controls</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-directory-manager-to-impersonate-other-users\">Allow Directory Manager to Impersonate Other Users</h3>\n<p>Proxy authorization allows the user that creates a connection to RadiantOne to impersonate/request access on behalf of another user. This allows authorization to be enforced for a user other than the one that creates the connection/binds to RadiantOne. By default, the RadiantOne super user (e.g. cn=directory manager) is not allowed to impersonate other users. If you want this special user to be able to impersonate other users (to enforce authorization based on other users instead of as the super user), enable the “Allow Directory Manager to Impersonate Other Users” option. Also, verify that the <a href=\"03-front-end-settings#proxied-authorization-control\">Proxy Authorization Control</a> is enabled for RadiantOne because this is the control that allows clients to request access on behalf of another user.</p>\n<!--\r\n\r\n### Bind Requires SSL or StartTLS\r\n\r\nIf a user binds to RadiantOne and provides a password, that password is vulnerable to interception by a third party when sent over non-SSL ports. To help prevent this vulnerability, you can enforce that binds always use the SSL/TLS ports by using the Bind requires SSL or StartTLS option.\r\n\r\n>[!warning] \r\n>As a best practice, it is recommended that you only allow SSL communication to the RadiantOne service. If you require non-SSL communication but still want to require that binds use SSL or StartTLS, you can use this option.\r\n\r\nThis option requires enabling SSL. If you want binds to use StartTLS, you must also enable StartTLS. Refer to [SSL Settings](security#ssl-settings) for more information on these settings.\r\n\r\nIf you enable Bind Requires SSL or StartTLS, to avoid problems when using the Main Control Panel you must enable “Use SSL” for internal connections in Main Control Panel > Settings > Internal Connections.

This may introduce security problems for the client application, or in certain cases where machines like printers may bind against RadiantOne, that do not verify that the client actually provided a password. If the Bind Requires Password setting is enabled, and no password is specified in the bind request, RadiantOne tries to bind the specified user and return an invalid credential error to the client. If Bind Requires Password is not enabled, and a bind request comes in with a valid user DN and no password, it is considered an anonymous bind. Bind requires Password is enabled by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-nested-groups\">Enable Nested Groups</h3>\n<p>If you have groups stored in a RadiantOne Universal Directory store and want to support groups as members, check the Enable Nested Groups option.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nProcessing nested groups is not efficient and is not enabled by default. When nested groups are used in RadiantOne ACLs for access controls, many recursive searches are required. Large groups with a mix of many members including other groups as members can have poor performance. Use nested groups with caution and validate your use case with performance testing to ensure response times meet your needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"ldap_matching_rule_in_chain\">LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne supports the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN operator and allows clients to issue search filters using the 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941 matching rule OID. This provides a method to look up the ancestry of an object and can be used in a search filter to retrieve all groups a user is a member of even when that group is nested (and is a member of another group). If the base DN in the RadiantOne namespace is associated with a proxy view, the search filter containing the matching rule OID is passed to the backend which must process the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN. If the base DN in the RadiantOne namespace is associated with a persistent cache or a Universal Directory store, RadiantOne processes the matching rule locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf you are using the Linked Attributes calculation in RadiantOne and the users and groups are local, in a persistent cache or Universal Directory store, you must enable the Optimize Linked Attribute setting to support filters requesting isMemberOf/memberOf.

The certificate also associates the entity with a public key.\n\nFor normal SSL communications, where the only requirement is that the client trusts the server, no additional configuration is necessary (if both entities trust each other). For mutual authentication, where there is a reciprocal trust relationship between the client and the server, the client must generate a certificate containing his identity and private key in his keystore. The client must also make a version of the certificate containing his identity and public key, which RadiantOne must store in its truststore. In turn, the client needs to trust the server; this is accomplished by importing the server's CA certificate into the client truststore.\n\n>[!note] \n>Certificate-based authentication (mutual authentication) requires the use of SSL or StartTLS for the communication between the client and RadiantOne.\n\nThe diagram below shows how certificates and the SSL protocol are used together for authentication.\n\n![An image showing ](Media/Image3.82.jpg)\n\nFigure 2: Mutual Authentication\n\nThere are three options for mutual authentication and this can be set from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL > Mutual Auth. Client Certificate drop-down menu: Required, Requested and None (default value). If mutual authentication is required, choose the Required option. If this option is selected, it forces a mutual authentication. If the client fails to provide a valid certificate which can be trusted by RadiantOne, authentication fails, and the TCP/IP connection is dropped.\n\nIf mutual authentication is not required, but you would like RadiantOne to request a certificate from the client, choose the Requested option. In this scenario, if the client provides a valid/trusted certificate, a mutual authentication connection is established. If the certificate presented is invalid, the authentication fails. If no certificate is presented, the connection continues (using a simple LDAP bind) but is not mutual authentication.\n\nIf you do not want RadiantOne to request a client certificate at all, check the None option.\n\nIf the client certificate is not signed by a known certificate authority, it must be added in the [RadiantOne client truststore](#client-certificate-trust-store-cluster-level-trust-store).\n\n#### Requiring Certificate-based Authentication\n\nIf you want to require certificate-based authentication:\n\n1. The client must trust the RadiantOne server certificate (import the RadiantOne public key certificate into the client truststore, unless the server certificate has been signed by a certificate authority known/trusted by the client).\n\n2. The RadiantOne service must trust the client (import the client’s public key certificate into the [RadiantOne client truststore](#client-certificate-trust-store-cluster-level-trust-store), unless the client certificate is signed by a known/trusted certificate authority).\n\n3. From the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL > Mutual Auth. Client Certificate drop-down menu, select Required.\n\n4. From the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL, click **Change** next to [Client Certificate DN Mapping](#client-certificate-dn-mapping) and define your mappings.\n\n>[!warning] \n>The Client Certificate DN Mapping is only accessible by a member of the [Directory Administrator role/group](01-introduction#delegated-administration-of-radiantone).\n\n5. Click **Save** and restart the RadiantOne service. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, restart RadiantOne on all nodes.\n\n### Client Certificate DN Mapping\n\nTo authorize a user who authenticates using a certificate (e.g. SASL External) you must set a client certificate DN mapping. This maps the user DN (Subject or Subject Alternate Name from the certificate) to a specific DN in the RadiantOne namespace. After, the DN in the RadiantOne namespace determines authorization (access controls). \n\n>[!note] \n>To avoid problems with special characters, RadiantOne normalizes the certificate subject prior to applying the certificate DN mapping.\n\nTo set the client certificate DN mapping:\n\n1. Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > SSL sub-section.\n\n2. Click **Change** next to the Client Certificate DN Mapping property.\n\n>[!warning] \n>The Client Certificate DN Mapping is only accessible by a member of the [Directory Administrator role/group](01-introduction#delegated-administration-of-radiantone).\n\nThere are different ways to determine the DN from the subject or subject alternative name in the certificate (using regular expression syntax).\n\nSetting a specific subject or subject alternative name to DN in the virtual namespace:\n\n```\ncn=lcallahan,dc=rli,dc=com (the user DN in the certificate) -> (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\n```\n\nSpecify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the subject or subject alternative name received in the certificate:\n\n```\nuid=(.+),dc=rli,dc=com -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)\n```\n\nIf RadiantOne received a certificate subject of uid=lcallahan,dc=rli,dc=com then it would look for the virtual entry based on:\n\n```\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)\n```\n\nThen, authorization would be based on the user DN that is returned.\n\nAs another option, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the previous example). Let’s take a look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:\n\n```\ncn=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=(.+),dc=com -> (maps to) ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=$1)(dc=$3))\n```\n\nIf RadiantOne received a subject from the certificate that looked like: cn=laura_callahan,dc=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com, the search that would be issued would look like:\n\n```\nou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))\n```\n\nRadiantOne uses the DN returned in the search result to base authorization on. \n\nIf the subject in the SSL certificate is blank, you can specify that a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) should be used. You can use an alternative name in the mapping by specifying {alt} before the regular expression. For example: {alt}^(.+)$ uses the first alternative name found. You can be more specific and specify which alternative name in the certificate that you want to match by specifying the type [0-8]. For example: {alt:0}^(.+)$ uses the otherName alternative name. The type number associated with each is shown below.\n\notherName                         [0]\nrfc822Name                       [1]\ndNSName                          [2]\nx400Address                      [3]\ndirectoryName                   [4]\nediPartyName                    [5]\nuniformResourceIdentifier  [6]\niPAddress                           [7]\nregisteredID                        [8]\n\nFor example, {alt:0}^(.+)@my.gov$ defined as the Certificate DN captures \"james.newt\" for the certificate shown below.\n\n![Example SSL Certificate](Media/Image3.83.jpg)\n \nFigure 2: Example SSL Certificate\n\nIf all mapping rules fail to locate a user, anonymous access is granted (if anonymous access is allowed to RadiantOne).\n\n>[!note] \n>As an alternative to anonymous access, it is generally recommended that you create a final mapping that results in associating the authenticated user with a default user that has minimum access rights. An example is shown below where the last mapping rule matches to a user identified in RadiantOne as “uid=default,ou=globalusers,cn=config”.\n\n![Example Default Mapping Rule](Media/Image3.84.jpg)\n\nFigure 3: Example Default Mapping Rule\n\n**Processing Multiple Mapping Rules**\n\nMany Client Certificate DN Mapping rules can be configured. They are processed by RadiantOne in the order they appear.\n\nThe first DN mapping rule in the list is applied first. IF the user is found with the first mapping rule, then no other rules are evaluated. ONLY if the user is NOT found using the first DN mapping rule will the other rules be evaluated. If all mapping rules fail to locate a user, anonymous access is granted (if anonymous access is allowed to RadiantOne).\n\nFor example, let’s say two DN Mapping rules have been configured:\n\n```\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)\nuid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com\n```\n\nThe first DN Mapping rule will be evaluated like:\n\n```\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=laura_callahan)\n```\n\nIf Laura Callahan’s entry is found from the search, authorization is based on this user DN (and the groups this user is a member of). If the account is not found, then the second mapping rule is evaluated. If all mapping rules fail to locate a user in the virtual namespace, the user who authenticated with the certificate is considered anonymous.\n\nOnly when the first DN mapping rule fails to find a user will the other DN mapping rules be used.\n\nRemember, changing any parameters related to SSL requires a restart of the RadiantOne service.\n\n### Client Certificates (Default Java Truststore)\n\nFor RadiantOne to connect via SSL to an underlying data source, or accept client certificates for authentication, the appropriate client certificate needs imported (unless they are signed by a trusted/known Certificate Authority). For classic RadiantOne architectures (active/active or active/passive), these certificates can be imported into the default Java trust store (<RLI_HOME>\\jdk\\jre\\lib\\security\\cacerts). \n\n>[!warning] \n>If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, import the client certificates into the [cluster level truststore](client-certificate-trust-store#client-certificate-trust-store-cluster-level-trust-store) instead of the default one so they can be dynamically shared across all cluster nodes.\n\nTo manage the client certificates contained in the default Java trust store, click **Manage** next to the Client Certificates property.\n\n![Managing Client Certificates in the Default Java Truststore](Media/Image3.85.jpg)\n\nFigure 4: Managing Client Certificates in the Default Java Truststore\n\n**Viewing Client Certificates**\n\nTo view a certificate, select the certificate in the list and click **View Certificate**. Valuable information about the certificate is shown (who issued the certificate, who the certificate was issued to, when the certificate is set to expire, status…etc.). From this location, you have the option to copy the certificate to a file.\n\n**Adding Client Certificates**\n\nTo add a certificate:\n\n1. Click **Add Certificate**. \n\n2. Browse to the location of the client certificate file and click **OK**. \n\n3. Click **Add Certificate**. \n\n4. Enter a short, unique name (alias) for the certificate and click **OK**. \n\n5. Enter the Key Store Password and click **OK**. The default password is changeit.The added certificate appears in the list.\n\n6. Click **Save** in the upper right corner.\n\n7. Restart the RadiantOne service.\n\n**Deleting Client Certificates**\n\nTo delete a certificate:\n\n1. Select the desired certificate and click **Delete Certificate**.\n\n2. Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.\n\n3. Click **Save** in the upper right corner.\n\n4. Restart the RadiantOne service.\n\n**Set Key Store Password**\n\nTo change the Key Store password (which by default is changeit):\n\n1. Click **Set Password**.\n\n2. Enter the old password, new password, and confirm the new password. Click **OK**.\n\n3. Save **Save** in the upper right corner.\n\n"},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"supported-cipher-suites"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Supported Cipher Suites"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To view the cipher strength levels enabled in RadiantOne, go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section and click "},{"type":"element","tagName":"code","properties":{"className":["language-text"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"View"}]},{"type":"text","value":" next to Supported Cipher Suites."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"enabled-ssl-protocols"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Enabled SSL Protocols"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To view the enabled SSL protocols enabled in RadiantOne, go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section.

It provides assurance that the entity claiming a particular identity, is the entity to which that identity was assigned. There are 5 levels of assurance used by RadiantOne to enforce access controls to data. The default level is no enforcement of assurance (Level 0). You can use this level when there is minimum risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data. \n\nLevel 1 indicates an authentication method of basic credentials (username+password) is required to access the data. At this level, there is little confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is low risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data. \n\nLevel 2 indicates an authentication method of Kerberos (leveraging GSSAPI) is required to access the data. At this level, there is some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is moderate risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data.\n\n>[!warning] \n>Ensure you have RadiantOne configured properly as a [Kerberos LDAP service](security#kerberos).\n\nLevel 3 indicates multi-factor authentication (e.g. RSA SecurID token code, Yubikey) is required to access the data. At this level, there is high confidence in the asserted identity's validity. You can use this level when there is high risk associated with the authentication strength used to access the RadiantOne data. \n\n\n>[!warning] \n>Ensure you have RadiantOne configured properly with a [Custom Authentication Provider](interception#custom-authentication-providers).\n\nLevel 4 indicates certificate-based (mutual) authentication is required to access the data. There is very high confidence in an asserted identity of the entity. This is the highest level of authentication assurance and should be used when there is very high risk associated with accessing the data.\n\n>[!warning] \n>Ensure you have RadiantOne configured properly for [Mutual Authentication](server-backend#mutual-authentication).\n\nSelect the assurance level from the drop-down list and select an operator.
