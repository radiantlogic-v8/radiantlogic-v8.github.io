As the number of directories continues to grow, and expands to cloud directories (e.g. Azure AD, Okta), getting a global view of identities and groups can be a huge challenge. In addition to the number of disparate directories, often containing overlapping user accounts that must be properly linked, directory vendors have variations in the how groups are managed. Some LDAP directory servers support dynamic groups. For dynamic groups, the membership is determined by search criteria using an LDAP URL as opposed to being maintained explicitly in a list. For example, suppose that you want a Sales group to contain every employee that has a title of Sales Manager. To do this, you create a dynamic group named Sales associated with the groupOfURLs objectclass. Then, instead of statically assigning member DNs as unique members (in the member or uniqueMember attribute), you define a memberURL attribute that contains the LDAP URL and criteria (search base, scope and filter) to be used for determining members of the group. Dynamic groups offer flexibility and less administration. However, it also becomes difficult to quickly get a list of members without issuing an additional query based on the memberURL criteria for each group. In Active Directory, group nesting, where a group can be a member of another group, is a way to simplify the aintenance of groups. This also offers flexibility and less administration but can be more cumbersome to quickly assess who is a member of which group(s).</p>\n<p>RadiantOne aggregates and links overlapping identities and addresses the complex challenges of determining group membership. It can evaluate LDAP dynamic groups and flatten nested groups to provide an accurate list of group members. RadiantOne also includes a web-based application named the Global Identity Viewer that administrators can use to search across disparate data sources for all identities and groups. This tool is for searching/auditing identities and groups. This guide describes the Global Identity Viewer application. A high-level diagram of the configuration process is depicted below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nFor assistance on using RadiantOne to integrate identities from disparate data sources, see the RadiantOne Global Identity Builder guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 528px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 69.0909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/7da28413598081d58c21cd3feee52e9b/ebba6/Image1.1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7da28413598081d58c21cd3feee52e9b/c1cfe/Image1.1.jpg 275w,\n/static/7da28413598081d58c21cd3feee52e9b/ebba6/Image1.1.jpg 528w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 1. 1 : High Level Process</p>\n<p>The Global Identity Viewer facilitates searching for identities and/or groups across all data sources that have been integrated in the Global Identity Builder project.
