Based on a polling interval configured, the connector connects with the user and password configured in the connection string/data source and checks the list of changes stored by Active Directory. The connector internally maintains the last processed change number (<code class=\"language-text\">uSNChanged</code> value) and this allows for the recovery of all changes that occur even if the connector is down (deliberately or due to failure).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nThis is the connector type that must be used if the backend is an Active Directory Global Catalog. The Active Directory DirSync connector shouldn't be used because it is unable to detect events in sub-domains.**\r\nAlso, If you are pointing the Active Directory connector to the Global Catalog, when a deleted entry is detected, the connector receives only the DN of the deleted entry in the context of the <code class=\"language-text\">CN=Deleted Objects</code> container (e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">CN=u1\\0ADEL:2ca20e8c-1748-4e7d-9044-45e64ab8105b,CN=Deleted Objects,DC=t1,DC=f6,DC=rli</code>). Transformation logic needs to address how to find the corresponding entry in the target(s) to remove or update them accordingly.**</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the sequence of events is critical, use the <a href=\"#active-directory-dirsync-connector\">DirSync connector</a> because it processes events in the order in which they occur instead of prioritizing and processing inserts and updates before deletes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nTo detect delete events, the service account used by RadiantOne to connect to the backend Active Directory (configured in the connection string of the RadiantOne data source) must have permissions to search the tombstone objects. More specifically, the LIST CONTENTS and READ PROPERTY permissions to the<code class=\"language-text\"> CN=Deleted Objects</code> branch are required. Generally, a member of the Administrators group is sufficient. However, some Active Directory servers may require a member of the Domain Admins group. Check with your Active Directory permissions to determine the appropriate credentials required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"active-directory-dirsync-connector\">Active Directory DirSync connector</h2>\n<p>The Active Directory DirSync capture connector retrieves changes that occur to entries in a directory by passing a cookie that identifies the directory state at the time of the previous DirSync search. The first time the DirSync capture connector is started, it stores a cookie in a cursor file. At the next polling interval, the connector performs a DirSync search to detect changes by sending the current cookie. These changes include only the objects and attributes that have changed since the previous state identified by the current cookie. Because it retrieves only changed objects and attributes, the Active Directory DirSync capture connector avoids propagating irrelevant attributes, reducing message size and potentially reducing network congestion. After retrieving changes, a new cookie is obtained, and the cursor file is updated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do not use this connector type if your backend is an Active Directory Global Catalog because it is unable to detect events in sub-domains. Use the <a href=\"overview.md#manually-update-connector-cursor\">Active Directory (USNChanged)</a> connector instead.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To detect delete events, the service account used by RadiantOne to connect to the backend Active Directory (configured in the connection string of the RadiantOne data source) must have permissions to search the tombstone objects. Generally, a member of the Administrators group is sufficient. However, some Active Directory servers may require a member of the Domain Admins group. Check with your Active Directory permissions to determine the appropriate credentials required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The DirSync capture connector is recommended for environments where the sequence of events is critical. The DirSync capture connector processes events in the order in which they occur, unlike the <a href=\"overview.md#manually-update-connector-cursor\">Active Directory USNChanged connector</a> which prioritizes inserts and updates before deletes.</p>\n<p>To use the DirSync control, the Bind DN connecting to the directory must have the DS-Replication-Get-Changes extended right, which can be enabled with the <strong>Replicating Directory Changes</strong> permission, on the root of the partition being monitored. By default, this right is assigned to the Administrator and LocalSystem accounts on domain controllers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThe DirSync capture connector does NOT capture changes to calculated attributes such as the <code class=\"language-text\">memberOf</code> attribute or moved entries (<code class=\"language-text\">modDN</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">modRDN</code> operations).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"active-directory-hybrid-connector\">Active Directory Hybrid connector</h2>\n<p>The Active Directory hybrid capture connector uses a combination of the uSNChanged and DirSync change detection mechanisms. The first time the connector starts, it gets a new cookie and the highest <code class=\"language-text\">uSNchanged</code> number. When the connector gets a new change (modify or delete), it makes an additional search using the DN of the entry and fetches the entry from AD. The fetched entry contains the <code class=\"language-text\">uSNChanged</code> attribute, so the connector updates the cursor values for both for the cookie and the last processed <code class=\"language-text\">uSNchanged</code> number.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nIf you are virtualizing and detecting changes from a Global Catalog, then you must use the Active Directory USNChanged changed connector because the Hybrid connector cannot detect change events on sub-domains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the connector restarts, uSNChanged detection catches the entries that have been modified or deleted while the connector was stopped. The LDAP search uses the last processed uSN to catch up. After the connector processes all entries, it requests a new cookie from AD (not from the cursor) and switches to DirSync change detection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"active-directory-connector-failover\">Active Directory connector failover</h2>\n<p>All Active Directory connectors have the ability to failover to a replica if the primary server is unavailable and the number of failure exceptions exceeds either the <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#max-retries-on-error\">Maximum Retries on Error</a> or <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#max-retries-on-connection-error\">Maximum Retries on Connection Error</a> value. This mechanism leverages the Active Directory replication vectors <code class=\"language-text\">[replUpToDateVector]</code>, and the failover servers configured at the level of the RadiantOne data source associated with Active Directory, to determinate which server(s) the connector switches to in case of failure. Since the replication vector contains all domains, in addition to some possibly retired domains, the connector narrows down the list of possible failover candidates to only the ones listed as failover servers in the RadiantOne data source associated with the Active Directory backend. If there are no failover server defined for the data source, all domains in the replication vector are possible candidates for failover.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nWhen defining the RadiantOne data source associated with Active Directory, do not use Host Discovery or Load Balancers. You must use the fully qualified machine names for the primary server and failover servers. Do not use IP addresses. Also, it is highly recommended that you list your desired failover servers at the level of the data source. Not only does this make the failover logic more efficient, but it also avoids delays in synchronization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">[replUpToDateVector]</code> definition: The non-replicated attribute <code class=\"language-text\">replUpToDateVector</code> is an optional attribute on the naming context root of every naming context replica. If this vector is unavailable, the connector is suspended.</p>\n<p>The ReplUpToDateVector type is a tuple with the following fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">uuidDsa</code>: The invocation ID of the DC that assigned <code class=\"language-text\">usnHighPropUpdate</code>.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">usnHighPropUpdate</code>: A USN at which an update was applied on the DC\r\nidentified by <code class=\"language-text\">uuidDsa</code>.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">timeLastSyncSuccess</code>: The time at which the last successful replication occurred from the DC identified by <code class=\"language-text\">uuidDsa</code>; for replication latency reporting only.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">[replUpToDateVector]</code> example:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>01ca6e90-7d20-4f9c-ba7b-823a72fc459e @ USN 2210490 @ Time 2005-08-21\r\n15:54:21\r\n\r\n1d9bb4b6-054a-440c-aedf-7a3f28837e7f @ USN 26245013 @ Time 2007-02-27\r\n10:17:33\r\n\r\n24980c9d-39fa-44d7-a153-c0c5c27f0577 @ USN 4606302 @ Time 2006-08-20\r\n23:33:09</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">01ca6e90-7d20-4f9c-ba7b-823a72fc459e @ USN <span class=\"token number\">2210490</span> @ Time <span class=\"token number\">2005</span>-08-21\r\n<span class=\"token number\">15</span>:54:21\r\n\r\n1d9bb4b6-054a-440c-aedf-7a3f28837e7f @ USN <span class=\"token number\">26245013</span> @ Time <span class=\"token number\">2007</span>-02-27\r\n<span class=\"token number\">10</span>:17:33\r\n\r\n24980c9d-39fa-44d7-a153-c0c5c27f0577 @ USN <span class=\"token number\">4606302</span> @ Time <span class=\"token number\">2006</span>-08-20\r\n<span class=\"token number\">23</span>:33:09</code></pre></div>\n<p>For more information on Active Directory replication please read <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772726(WS.10).aspx\">how the Active Directory replication model works</a> and this <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.10.replication.aspx\">guide to Active Directory replication</a>.</p>\n<p>At run-time, the connector retrieves the entire list of servers defined in the replication vector and reduces the number of possible failover candidates based on failover servers defined in the RadiantOne data source (if any). The list of potential failover servers is stored at each polling interval. When the current server fails, and retries are exhausted, the connector decides to switch to the closest candidate by selecting the server with the maximum timestamp from the up-to-dateness vector. The capture connector's cursor is assigned the value from the up-to-dateness vector for the failover server. If the closest candidate fails as well, the connector tries with a second closest candidate and so on.</p>\n<p>Important things to keep in mind about the different Active Directory connector types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Active Directory USNChanged connector - Due to the lack of Active Directory replication for the <code class=\"language-text\">USNChanged</code> attribute, some changes could be missed or replayed on failover.</li>\n<li>For AD LDS backends, a special user for the connector must exist under the <code class=\"language-text\">CN=Configuration</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">CN={...}</code> naming context. This account must be configured in the RadiantOne LDAP data source associated with the AD LDS backend. This user must have permissions to read everything under the Root DSE, (e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">CN=Configuration</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">CN={...}</code>), and the AD LDS branch that the connector is monitoring for changes. All AD LDS instances must run on different computers and must listen on the same ports.</li>\n<li>Active Directory DirSync connector – When the connector fails over to another DC replica, the connector may receive all objects and attributes instead of just the delta since the last request. Therefore, you may notice the number of entries published by the connector is more than you were expecting. This behavior is dictated by the Active Directory server and is out of the control of the connector. Keep this in mind when you define the Max Retries and Retry Intervals for the connector properties. The smaller the number of retries, the higher the chance the connector will failover and the greater potential of receiving all objects and attributes (a full sync) from the domain controller.</li>\n<li>Active Directory Hybrid connector – leverages a mix of both USNChanged and DirSync functionalities during failover. After the failover server is found, uSNChanged detection catches the entries that have been modified or deleted since the connector's failure. The LDAP search uses the last processed <code class=\"language-text\">uSNChanged</code> number to catch up. After the connector processes all entries, it requests a new cookie from Active Directory and switches to DirSync change detection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"configuration\">Configuration</h2>\n<p>Set the connector type in the pipeline configuration by choosing the <strong>Capture</strong> component.

For properties common to all connectors, see <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#common-properties-for-all-connectors\">Configure capture connector types and properties</a>. Properties related to filtering of events are configured in the Event Filtering section. Properties related to the contents of the messages published by the connector are configured in the <a href=\"configure-connector-types-and-properties.md#event-contents\">Event Contents</a> section. All other properties are configured in the Advanced Properties section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"event-filtering\">Event filtering</h3>\n<p>When a connector collects changed entries, it can filter out the ones that are not needed. There are three properties used for filtering: LDAP Filter, Excluded Branches and Included Branches. These properties are described below.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ldap-filter\">LDAP Filter</h4>\n<p>To further condition the entries that are published, you can indicate the desired criteria in the LDAP Filter property. This is a post filter, used to qualify which entries are included in the message published by the connector. You must enter a valid LDAP filter in the property.</p>\n<p>This property can be used to reduce the size of the message by only including desired entries (that match the filter). This can also help reduce the amount of transformation logic needed because you can easily avoid synchronizing certain entries without needing the logic to abort them in the transformation script.</p>\n<p>If a captured entry matches the criteria indicated in the LDAP filter property, it is published in the message by the connector. If it doesn't, the entry is not published in the message. Information about the skipped entries is in the connector log (with log level 4).</p>\n<p>If the captured change type is delete, and not enough information is known about the entry, the LDAP filter is not used and the entry is published in the message. For example, if the LDAP filter property contained a value of <code class=\"language-text\">(l=Novato)</code> and the captured entry did not contain an <code class=\"language-text\">l</code> attribute, the LDAP filter is not applied and the entry is published in the message.</p>\n<p>If the captured change type is not delete (e.g. insert, update, move, etc.), and not enough information is known about the entry, the LDAP filter is still used and the entry is not published into the message. For example, if the LDAP filter property contained a value of <code class=\"language-text\">(l=Novato)</code> and the captured entry did not contain an <code class=\"language-text\">l</code> attribute, the LDAP filter is still applied and the entry is not published in the message.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nThis property can be updated while the connector is running and takes effect without restarting the connector.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"excluded-branches\">Excluded Branches</h4>\n<p>To further condition the entries that are published, you can indicate one or more branches to exclude. In the Excluded Branches property, enter one or more suffixes associated with entries that should not be published by the connector. Select <strong>Enter</strong> after each suffix. An example is shown below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4460d925f75985569163154e3e507189/78797/image9.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 15.950920245398773%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAADCAIAAAAcOLh5AAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAZ0lEQVQI123LWQqDQBAEUO9/xpGMQU1EBJ0wi71UB5EEUZv3UVXQFQBVEAuxYC9Xp/uNlZkBtsQS0ioKhSlMdPPPfGd7ziuPc5xCCqmELK551b7z7fDsR/do66bv3lMmO/okmiMVti8yHq74e4VfGAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Two suffixes entered in the Excluded Branches property\"\n        title=\"Two suffixes entered in the Excluded Branches property\"\n        src=\"/static/4460d925f75985569163154e3e507189/a6d36/image9.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4460d925f75985569163154e3e507189/222b7/image9.png 163w,\n/static/4460d925f75985569163154e3e507189/ff46a/image9.png 325w,\n/static/4460d925f75985569163154e3e507189/a6d36/image9.png 650w,\n/static/4460d925f75985569163154e3e507189/e548f/image9.png 975w,\n/static/4460d925f75985569163154e3e507189/78797/image9.png 1125w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If the changed entry DN contains a suffix that matches the excluded branches value, or is a change in the exact entry that is listed (e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">ou=dept1,ou=com</code>), this entry is not published by the connector.

In the case of modify DN/RDN operations, Active Directory does not provide information about the old DN of the entry making it impossible for the connector to propagate a delete operation for the old DN/entry.</p>\n<p>If you require DN/RDN changes to be processed by the connector as a <code class=\"language-text\">modDN/modRDN</code> operation (so the target data source(s) get the change as a <code class=\"language-text\">modDN/modRDN</code>), set the Determine Move Operations property to: <code class=\"language-text\">true</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nThe connector must be restarted for this property to take effect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the Determine Move Operations property is enabled, the connector maintains a cache mapping the objectGUID to DN for each Active Directory entry. This allows the connector to detect and propagate the event as a <code class=\"language-text\">modDN/modRDN</code> (move) operation. All entries from Active Directory must be read the first time when the connector starts/restarts to populate the cache. This increases the amount of time it takes for the connector to start and be able to capture changes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nWhen defining the data source for the backend Active Directory, check the Paged Results Control option to ensure that all entries can be retrieved from the backend. This is required for the connector to get all entries in the cache to map objectGUID to DN and support <code class=\"language-text\">modDN/modRDN</code> operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"synchronize-password\">Synchronize Password</h4>\n<p>If your use case requires synchronizing passwords from Active Directory, make sure the <code class=\"language-text\">unicodePwd</code> attribute is in your attribute mappings (to the <code class=\"language-text\">unicodePwd</code> attribute if the target is Active Directory or <code class=\"language-text\">userPassword</code> attribute if the target is RadiantOne Universal Directory) and set the Synchronize Password property for the capture connector to <code class=\"language-text\">true</code>. The default is <code class=\"language-text\">false</code>, meaning the capture connector does not get the passwords from Active Directory.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nThe capture connector retrieves only the MD4 hashed password value – not the password value in clear. Therefore, password synchronization is only supported for Active Directory targets or RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) targets.\r\nIf there is an error when capturing passwords in the Active Directory backend, the connector retries 3 times. After three failures, the connector logs an error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the Synchronize Password property is set to <code class=\"language-text\">true</code>, the connector can get an Active Directory user's password when it requests the entry. This can be used for both initializing a target Active Directory and/or RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) store and synchronizing password changes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nThe ability to get passwords is supported for Active Directory 2008 R2(+) backends. RadiantOne must be deployed on a Windows OS. All Windows updates should be applied to both the machine hosting RadiantOne and the backend Active Directory machine. The credentials configured in the Active Directory data source for RadiantOne must have the following permissions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Domain Level</strong>: Read, Replicating Directory Changes, Replicating Directory Changes All, Replicating Directory Changes in Filtered Set.</li>\n<li><strong>Ou Level</strong>: Read all properties.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To leverage the Active Directory native replication mechanism to get the password, Microsoft recommends the following firewall ports are opened between the Active Directory server and the RadiantOne machine. Check with your Active Directory administrator to confirm these ports.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>PORTS</th>\n<th>PURPOSE</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>TCP 135</td>\n<td>RPC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TCP 139</td>\n<td>NetBIOS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TCP and UDP 389</td>\n<td>LDAP <br /> *This could be used by RadiantOne to get the user information.
