To mitigate against online password cracking attacks against this account, use a strong password that is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least 9 characters long</li>\n<li>Does not contain any dictionary words</li>\n<li>Contains a mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Provide this password only to trusted administrators with business need for super user access. Other accounts used by RadiantOne are managed by backend data sources and subject to lockout policies associated with those backend data sources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limit-usage-of-directory-manager-account\">Limit Usage of Directory Manager Account</h2>\n<p>Knowledge and usage of the RadiantOne super user (e.g. cn=Directory Manager) credentials should be limited. It is highly recommended to use the delegated administrator accounts to manage RadiantOne configuration instead of the super user account. Add your users to the\r\nappropriate delegated administrator groups to define the roles they should have for managing the RadiantOne configuration. For details on what activities the delegated administrators can perform, please see the RadiantOne System Admin Guide.</p>\n<p>For details on updating the RadiantOne super user (e.g. cn=directory manager) credentials, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n<!--\r\n\r\n## Limit Access as Directory Manager to Specific Clients\r\n\r\nTo help prevent against the unwarranted use of the directory administrator account, you can set specific IP addresses from where the directory administrator account can connect to the RadiantOne service from. This value can be a single IP address or a list of IP addresses separated by a comma. The syntax can also support a range of IP addresses. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are allowed and a mix of both is supported.\r\n\r\nThis parameter can be changed in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Administration section. On the right side, set the value below the Allowed IPs parameter.\r\n\r\n>[!warning] \r\n>If you use this setting, you must list the IP address of each RadiantOne node in addition to the addresses from all servers you want the directory administrator to connect from. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, you must list all IP addresses for all nodes.\r\n\r\nFor more details and example syntax, please see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.\r\n\r\n-->\n<h2 id=\"update-default-delegated-admin-account-passwords\">Update Default Delegated Admin Account Passwords</h2>\n<p>There are eight groups used for delegated administration are Directory Administrator, Namespace Administrator, Operator, Schema Administrator, ACI Administrator, ICS Administrator, ICS Operator, and one role for Read Only access. Default administrative users are included as members of these groups. They are as follows:</p>\n<p>uid=aciadmin,ou=globalusers,cn=config\r\nMember of the ACI Administrator Group.</p>\n<p>uid=icsadmin,ou=globalusers,cn=config\r\nMember of the ICS Administrator Group.</p>\n<p>uid=icsoperator,ou=globalusers,cn=config\r\nMember of the ICS Operator Group.</p>\n<p>uid=namespaceadmin,ou=globalusers,cn=config\r\nMember of the Namespace Administrator Group.</p>\n<p>uid=operator,ou=globalusers,cn=config\r\nMember of the Operator Group.</p>\n<p>uid=readonly,ou=globalusers,cn=config\r\nMember of the Read Only Group.</p>\n<p>uid=schemaadmin,ou=globalusers,cn=config\r\nMember of the Schema Administrator Group.</p>\n<p>uid=superadmin,ou=globalusers,cn=config\r\nMember of the Directory Administrator Group.</p>\n<p>You can use these default users for delegated administration of RadiantOne activities, or you can add your own users to the various admin roles as described in the Managing Delegation Administration Roles section in the RadiantOne System Administration Guide. To use the default users, you can log in to the Main Control Panel with any of the following (depending on the configuration you want to manage). For details on the privileges and associated activities these users can perform, please see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n<p>user: aciadmin\r\npassword: &#x3C;set to the same password you defined for the super user (cn=directory manager)\r\nduring the installation></p>\n<p>user: icsadmin\r\npassword: &#x3C;set to the same password you defined for the super user (cn=directory manager)\r\nduring the installation></p>\n<p>user: icsoperator\r\npassword: &#x3C;set to the same password you defined for the super user (cn=directory manager)\r\nduring the installation></p>\n<p>user: namespaceadmin\r\npassword: &#x3C;set to the same password you defined for the super user (cn=directory manager)\r\nduring the installation></p>\n<p>user: operator\r\npassword: &#x3C;set to the same password you defined for the super user (cn=directory manager)\r\nduring the installation></p>\n<p>user: readonly\r\npassword: &#x3C;set to the same password you defined for the super user (cn=directory manager)\r\nduring the installation></p>\n<p>user: schemaadmin\r\npassword: &#x3C;set to the same password you defined for the super user (cn=directory manager)\r\nduring the installation></p>\n<p>user: superadmin\r\npassword: &#x3C;set to the same password you defined for the super user (cn=directory manager)\r\nduring the installation></p>\n<p>By default, the password for the delegated admin accounts is set to the same password you defined for the super user (cn=directory manager) during the installation of RadiantOne. It is recommended that you change these passwords to match your company security policy and/or follow the same recommendations as detailed in <a href=\"#protect-and-monitor-access-to-the-directory-manager-account\">Protect and Monitor Access to the Directory Manager Account</a>. You can also define strong <a href=\"#configure-strong-password-policies\">password policies</a> to ensure further protection of these accounts. Or you can delete the default users and assign your own.</p>\n<p>To change the password:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Log in to the Main Control Panel as the directory manager and select the Directory Browser tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate below cn=config > ou=globalusers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the entry representing the user whose password you want to change.

Only members of these groups can login to the Main Control Panel.</p>\n<p>The eight groups used for delegated administration are Directory Administrator, Namespace Administrator, Operator, Schema Administrator, ACI Administrator, ICS Administrator, ICS Operator, and one role for Read Only access. To add or remove members, log into the Main Control Panel as the super user and click on the Directory Browser tab. Navigate below ou=globalgroups,cn=config node to locate all of the groups. Select the group you want to manage and click the Manage Group button. From here you can remove users from groups and search for new users (located anywhere in the RadiantOne namespace) to add to groups. For complete configuration steps, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n<p>It is recommended that only users required to configure and administer RadiantOne get assigned to these groups.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leverage-piv-cards-to-login-to-the-control-panel\">Leverage PIV Cards to Login to the Control Panel</h3>\n<p>Log into the Control Panel using a PIV Card/Certificate as an alternative to using username and password.

The basic configuration and state information that are stored in ZooKeeper pose a generally low security risk. However, if your corporate policies dictate that all internal services must connect to each other via SSL/TLS, you can configure this secure connection between RadiantOne nodes and ZooKeeper. A high-level architecture depicting the certificates involved is shown below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 42.54545454545454%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing the high-level architecture\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/1a595c0032e57df7e559d6e1bc3668a0/b966c/Image2.2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1a595c0032e57df7e559d6e1bc3668a0/c1cfe/Image2.2.jpg 275w,\n/static/1a595c0032e57df7e559d6e1bc3668a0/67061/Image2.2.jpg 550w,\n/static/1a595c0032e57df7e559d6e1bc3668a0/b966c/Image2.2.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>The configuration of SSL between RadiantOne and ZooKeeper must be configured after installation.

The work-around is to use firewall rules to block traffic on that non-ssl port in ZooKeeper.</p>\n<p>As outlined in the diagram above, each node (RadiantOne and ZooKeeper nodes) currently maintains their own certificate truststores. The following steps outline the overall process and use the default certificates included in the installation. For production, you will replace these certificates with your own CA-signed ones, and if you use a known/trusted Certificate Authority then you shouldn’t need to import the public key certificates into all the corresponding truststores (as outlined in the steps below).
