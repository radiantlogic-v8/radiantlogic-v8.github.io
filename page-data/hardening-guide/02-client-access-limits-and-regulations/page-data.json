This parameter can be changed from the\r\nMain Control Panel > Settings Tab > Limits section > Global Limits sub-section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"look-through-limit\">Look Through Limit</h3>\n<p>The look through limit is the maximum number of entries you want the server to check in response to a search request. You should use this value to limit the number of entries the server looks through to find an entry. This limits the processing and time spent by the RadiantOne service to respond to potentially bogus search requests (for example, if a client sends a search filter based on an attribute that isn’t indexed). This parameter can be changed from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Limits section > Global Limits sub-section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"idle-connection-timeout\">Idle Connection Timeout</h3>\n<p>The length of time to keep a connection open without any activity from the client. This parameter can be changed from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Limits section > Global Limits sub-section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-limits\">Custom Limits</h3>\n<p>Custom limits are more fine-grained and override any Global Limits that are defined. These are defined on the Main Control Panel > Settings > Limits > Custom Limits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"access-regulation\">Access Regulation</h3>\n<p>After a client connects to RadiantOne, the amount of activity they can perform can be limited by configuring access regulation. The activity checking can be performed based on the user that connects to RadiantOne. Access regulation is defined from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Limits section > Per User.</p>\n<p>The “Restrictions Checking Interval” parameter indicate is the time frame in which the activity (max binds and max operations) is monitored. Once the time interval is reached, the counts are reset. For example, if Special Users Group checking is enabled, and the checking interval, max bind operations per checking interval and\r\nmax operations per checking interval are set to 300, 30 and 10 respectively, during a 5 minute (300 secs) period, anyone who is a member of the special users group can bind no more than 30 times to the RadiantOne service and not perform more than 10 operations. This count resets every 5 minutes. If a user attempts to perform more than the allowed number of operations, the RadiantOne service refuses the operation, and the client must wait until the checking interval resets.</p>\n<p>For more details on configuring access regulation per user and/or per computer, please see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"chapter-2-client-access-limits-and-regulation"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Chapter 2: Client Access Limits and Regulation"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"access-limits"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Access Limits"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Access limits are related to how the server handles activity received from clients.
