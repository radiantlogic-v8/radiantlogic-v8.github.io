This certificate is also used for HTTPS access to the Control Panels. It is\r\nrecommended to replace the default self-signed certificate with a CA-signed certificate that complies with your corporate security policy. Please see the RadiantOne System Administration\r\nGuide for more information.\r\n\r\nBelow is a high-level architecture diagram depicting the communication between the different layers (clients to RadiantOne and RadiantOne to backend data sources). This provides a glimpse of the different certificates, keystores and truststores involved. All components at the RadiantOne layer are installed on the same server.\r\n\r\n![An image showing the ](Media/Image4.1.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Forbid Access to RadiantOne on the Non-SSL Port\r\n\r\nIf SSL has been enabled for RadiantOne and you want to forbid access on the non-SSL port, follow the steps below.\r\n\r\n>[!warning] \r\n>If you have not enabled SSL for RadiantOne and set a value of 0 for the standard port, the RadiantOne service does not start at all.\r\nTherefore, be sure to enable the SSL port before setting the standard port to 0.\r\n\r\n1. Stop the RadiantOne service (from the Dashboard tab in the Main Control Panel or as a service if it is installed as a service). If running in a cluster, shutdown the RadiantOne  service on all nodes starting with the follower/follower-only nodes and stopping the leader node last. View the leader/follower status of each node from the Main Control Panel dashboard tab. Take note of the current leader node (noted with the yellow-colored triangle).\r\n2. Go to the Settings tab > Server Front End > Administration section.\r\n3. On the right side, enter a value of 0 (zero) in the LDAP Port field.\r\n4. Click **Save**.\r\n5. On the Settings tab, navigate to Security > SSL.\r\n6. In the Inter Nodes Communication section, check the option to Always use SSL.\r\n7. Click **Save**.\r\n8. Go to the Settings tab > Server Front End > Administration and set the Admin HTTP port to 0.\r\n9. Click **Save**.\r\n10. Go to the Settings tab > Server Front End > Other Protocols section.\r\n11. On the right side, enter a value of 0 (zero) in the HTTP port field.\r\n12. Click **Save**.\r\n13. On the Settings Tab, navigate to Server Backend > Internal Connections (requires [Expert Mode](00-preface.md#expert-mode)).\r\n14. Check the Use SSL checkbox and click Save.\r\n15. Start the RadiantOne service from the Dashboard tab (or start the service if you have configured it to run as a service). Start the RadiantOne service on all nodes if running in a cluster, starting with the previous leader node first (you took note of this in step 1 above).\r\n16. On the Settings tab, navigate to Server Backend -> LDAP Data Sources.\r\n17. On the right, select the vdsha data source and click EDIT.\r\n18. Change the port to the SSL port and check the SSL checkbox.\r\n19. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, the failover servers associated with the vdsha data source must have the port updated also. In the Failover LDAP Servers section, select a failover server and click Edit. Check the SSL checkbox, enter the SSL port and click OK.\r\n20. Click **Save**.\r\n21. Select the replicationjournal data source and click EDIT.\r\n22. Change the port to the SSL port and check the SSL checkbox.\r\n23. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, the failover servers associated with the replicationjournal data source must have the port updated also. In the Failover LDAP Servers section, select a failover server and click Edit. Check the SSL checkbox, enter the SSL port and click **OK**.\r\n24. If the replicationjournal data source points to a remote cluster, to support SSL access, the remote RadiantOne node’s public key certificate must be signed by a known/trusted CA or imported into the Main Control Panel > Settings > Security > Client Certificate Truststore.\r\n25. Click Save.\r\n\r\nIf you use the Main Control Panel, Directory Browser tab to manage entries, you can have connection problems if you turn off the non-SSL port and your browser (client) doesn’t trust the RadiantOne server certificate. The Directory Browser tab accesses the RadiantOne service via the REST web service ports. If the non-SSL port is off, it must use the HTTPS port.\r\n\r\nIf you are using a self-signed server certificate, you must install/trust the RadiantOne server certificate into your Internet browser. This can be done with the steps below.\r\n\r\n>[!note] \r\n>This is also applicable if you are simply accessing the Control Panel via the HTTPS port (e.g. 7171) even if the non-SSL is still available. This is because when you access the Main Control Panel via HTTPS, it connects to the RadiantOne service on the HTTPS web service port (https://rliserver:8090) and this requires the browser to trust the RadiantOne node’s server certificate. The [diagram](04-recommendations-for-securing-data-in-transit-ssl-tls-settings.md) shown at the beginning of this chapter depicts the different certificates, keystores and truststores in the architecture and is helpful to\r\nunderstand where certificates need to be imported.**\r\n\r\n1. Open your Internet Browser (as an administrator, in order to install the RadiantOne server certificate when prompted) and navigate to RadiantOne on the HTTPS port (e.g. https://radiantoneserver:8090)\r\n2. The browser should warn you about the certificate. Select to continue/proceed.\r\n3. Click on the \"Certificate Error\" red area in the address bar, to show information about the certificate.\r\n\r\n![An image showing the certificate error](Media/Image4.2.jpg)\r\n\r\n4. You should have the option to install it, which you should do, in Trusted Root Certificates.\r\n\r\n![An image showing the trusted root certificates](Media/Image4.3.jpg)\r\n\r\n5. Restart your browser after installing the certificate.\r\n\r\n6. If your browser does not have the option to install it, you can export the certificate and then import it directly in your browser settings. Below is an example for Google Chrome.\r\n7. Click the Certificate Information link.\r\n\r\n![An image showing the certificate information link](Media/Image4.4.jpg)\r\n\r\n8. On the Details tab, click Copy to File.\r\n9. Click Next in the Certificate Export Wizard.\r\n10. Choose DER encoded binary and click Next. Enter a file name (e.g. jetty.cer) and click Next.\r\n11. Click Finish and then click OK.\r\n12. Go to your Internet browser settings. The example below shows the Google Chrome browser settings.\r\n\r\n![An image showing the Settings option](Media/Image4.5.jpg)\r\n\r\n13. Under settings, click Show Advanced Settings.\r\n14. Click Manage Certificates in the HTTPS/SSL section.\r\n\r\n![An image showing the Manage Certificates button](Media/Image4.6.jpg)\r\n\r\n15. On the Trusted Root Certification Authorities tab, click **Import**.\r\n16. Click **Next** in the Certificate Import Wizard.\r\n17. Click **Browse** to navigate to the certificate file you exported above.\r\n18. Click **Next**.\r\n19. Click **Next**.\r\n20. Click **Finish**.\r\n21. Click **OK** to exit the confirmation.\r\n22. Click **Close** to close the certificate window.\r\n\r\nRestart your browser and then go to the Main Control Panel again on the HTTPS port.
