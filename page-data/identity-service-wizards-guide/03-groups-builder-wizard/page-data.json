With this wizard, you can define rules for dynamically creating groups from multiple heterogeneous data sources. Administrators can utilize this wizard to either create user-defined or auto-generated groups.</p>\n<p>For user-defined groups, you specify a group name and who you want the members of this group to be. The members can either be statically defined by looking for specific user accounts to add, or dynamically defined based on an LDAP filter where any user matching the LDAP filter will populate the group.</p>\n<p>For auto-generated groups, the group name is generated based on a specified attribute available in user entries. An administrator selects which attribute contains the possible group names. For example, if all user entries contained a location attribute, possible group names could be determined by creating a unique list of all possible locations. The list is then the basis for creating the group names. The group members are then dynamically defined based on who contains this attribute value.</p>\n<p>For more information on groups supported in RadiantOne please see the System Administration Guide.</p>\n<p>The Groups Builder wizard should be used in situations where applications will be accessing the RadiantOne service to retrieve groups/membership for enforcing authorization and a list of applicable groups either does not currently exist in any backend data source or the existing groups are insufficient because they lack all of the required members. This wizard should be used if there is the need to add new members into existing groups or if there is the need to build entirely new global groups containing members from multiple different data sources.</p>\n<p>The wizard guides you through the steps needed to create a project to build virtual groups that can either be user-defined (a set group name with specific members or dynamic members based on an LDAP filter) or auto-generated (group names and members can be auto-generated based on an LDAP filter). The wizard also guides you through mounting the view in the virtual namespace and configuring the caching option that best suits your needs.</p>\n<p>The detailed steps are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Log in to the Main Control Panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the Wizards tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the Groups Builder button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click Next on the Welcome screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter a name for the project and a description (optional).
