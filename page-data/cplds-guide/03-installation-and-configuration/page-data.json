The synchronization process can use either a direct connection to the backend, or an LDIF file generated from the LDAP backend. If you choose the LDIF file option, you are responsible for periodically generating the file(s) from your LDAP source(s).</p>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Install RadiantOne as a follower-only node that joins the existing cluster. For detailed installation steps, see the RadiantOne ReadMe.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE - These nodes should not be accessible by consuming client applications, so do not add them to your front-end load balancer configuration. This separates the synchronization tasks from the RadiantOne nodes that are servicing client applications.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Locate the cloud ID associated with the RadiantOne follower-only node(s) from the Main Control Panel > Dashboard tab. Make a note of the Cloud ID as it is used in the next step.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unregister RadiantOne FID on the follower-only nodes since it is not used. To do so, on one of the core nodes in the cluster, run the following command (using cluster.bat on Windows, cluster.sh on Linux):</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-<rli_home\">/bin/advanced/cluster.bat unregister &lt;instance name</code></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can use a value of vds_server as the instance name if you only have one RadiantOne instance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"directory-backend-configuration\">Directory Backend Configuration</h2>\n<p>This configuration uses RadiantOne’s LDAP Data Source option to connect directly to the backends as described below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>All directory backends must be created as LDAP data sources on a core cluster node. The base DN configured in the data source must be the location in the source directory containing the entries applicable for synchronizing into the target RadiantOne Universal Directory store. LDAP data sources can be created from the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Server Backend section. If you need assistance, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide. If you have many LDAP data sources to define, using the command line utility is more efficient than using the Control Panel. For details, see the create-ldap-datasource command in the RadiantOne Command Line Configuration Guide.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create the naming context for the RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) store on a core cluster node from the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace tab. If you need assistance, see the RadiantOne Namespace Configuration Guide.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Define access controls from the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Security section > Access Controls for the RadiantOne Universal Directory store making it read-only for clients. The capture process is a one-way sync from the LDAP backends into RadiantOne Universal Directory, meaning that the store must be a read-only replica to consuming clients. If you need assistance configuring access controls, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Switch to <a href=\"01-introduction#expert-mode\">Expert mode</a> in the Main Control to display the Distributed Directories Aggregation tab for the selected RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) store on the Directory Namespace tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Distributed Directories Aggregation tab, check the option to enable the process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) Enter a validation threshold to validate the generated image prior to executing the sync process. The threshold is a percentage of the total entries. For example, if you set a value of 50 (meaning 50%), it means that if the generated image contains 50% more or 50% less entries than the current RadiantOne Universal Directory store image, the sync process is aborted for this refresh cycle. If a threshold is not configured (set to 0), the Worker sync process compares the generated image from the backend to the current RadiantOne Universal Directory image and updates the store based on the differences between the two.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configure the process schedule by either entering the number of seconds or using a CRON expression. Click the Assist button if you need help defining the CRON expression.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) In some cases, certain attributes are not returned by the LDAP backend even if the Worker process requests all attributes. These attributes are typically known as operational attributes and you must ask for them specifically by name. If you would like the Worker process to always request specific operational attributes you can set them in Always Requested Attributes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) To exclude attributes from the LDAP backend prior to the comparison with the RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) store, enter a comma-separated list of attributes in the Ignored Attributes setting. This is a post filtering where the attributes listed are excluded from the generated image before it is compared to the RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) store.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LDAP data sources were defined in step 1 of this section. All LDAP backends that contain data to be synchronized into the RadiantOne Universal Directory store must be added on the Distributed Directories Aggregation tab. Click ADD and enter the data source name along with the corresponding target based DN in the RadiantOne Universal Directory. If you have multiple data sources to add, copy and pasting the data source name along with target base DN mapping from a CSV file is more efficient. Create a CSV file (or basic text file) containing the LDAP data source name along with the corresponding target RadiantOne Universal Directory base DN. Use a <tab> between the data source name and target base DN.

To make a network share accessible to the nodes, create a mapped drive on each node in the cluster pointing to the network share containing the LDIF file. Record the mapped network share path as it is required for the RadiantOne custom data source configuration.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note – This mapped drive location, including drive letter, must match across all nodes in the cluster.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>A pre-sync script can be used, for example, to extract a compressed LDIF file, validate entries within the source LDIF file, filter, and edit the LDIF file. If your LDIF file is in a location inaccessible to the nodes in your cluster (such as the cloud), you must define a pre-sync script that copies the LDIF onto the worker node(s). Store a copy of the script on each worker node in the same location on each node. The worker node tasked with running the synchronization at the next sync interval runs the pre-sync script and downloads the LDIF file. If, in the next sync interval, another worker node is tasked with syncing the same datasource, it uses the script to download the LDIF file.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note – After processing, the script outputs the file to &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/ ldif/import/&#x3C;customDataSourceName_processed>.ldif. This path cannot be modified.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>All backends must be created as custom data sources on a core cluster node. Custom data sources can be created from the Main Control Panel  Settings tab  Server Backend section. If you are not using a pre-sync script, only the URL parameter is required for the custom data source. The value for the URL parameter must indicate the absolute path in the source directory to the LDIF applicable for synchronizing into the target RadiantOne Universal Directory store.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 551px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8baa69742db3da91f9650bbdac449232/7ee2f/Image3.2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 43.558282208588956%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/8baa69742db3da91f9650bbdac449232/7ee2f/Image3.2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8baa69742db3da91f9650bbdac449232/d2f63/Image3.2.jpg 163w,\n/static/8baa69742db3da91f9650bbdac449232/c989d/Image3.2.jpg 325w,\n/static/8baa69742db3da91f9650bbdac449232/7ee2f/Image3.2.jpg 551w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If you do use a pre-sync script, two parameters are required for the custom data source.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>URL: the value for this parameter indicates the absolute path in the source directory to the LDIF (i.e. s3://bucketName/folderName/lg100k.ldif, or F://lg100k.ldif).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Presync script: the value for this parameter is the location of the pre-sync script on the worker node(s) (i.e. C:/Users/Administrator/scripts/script.bat).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 549px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0b376cff2212c94487926493f26c8b6e/588f6/Image3.3.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 41.104294478527606%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/0b376cff2212c94487926493f26c8b6e/588f6/Image3.3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0b376cff2212c94487926493f26c8b6e/d2f63/Image3.3.jpg 163w,\n/static/0b376cff2212c94487926493f26c8b6e/c989d/Image3.3.jpg 325w,\n/static/0b376cff2212c94487926493f26c8b6e/588f6/Image3.3.jpg 549w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note – For assistance with creating data sources, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.
