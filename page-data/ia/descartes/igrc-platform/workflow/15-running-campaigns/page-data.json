It allows a campaign to be run before its official next execution date.

This campaign is ignored but you can force an execution with this option.

This workflow does NOT launch campaigns each time it is run. Its objective is to check if the conditions are met to launch a campaign, if yes, the campaign is launched and the next execution date is updated in the database. So the next day, when this same workflow run again, it will do nothing as the campaign is already running and the next execution date is still in the future.</p>\n<p>The campaign manager facet is delivered with such a workflow to launch the campaigns.
