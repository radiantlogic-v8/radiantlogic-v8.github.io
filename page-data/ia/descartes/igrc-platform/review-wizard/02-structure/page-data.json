This process is the one launched when the campaign owner starts his campaign.</p>\n<p>The master process finds how the reviewed items will be split. For an account review by repository managers, the split is by repository.\nThe master process launches as many sub-processes as entities for the split. For example, if we have 3 repositories, we will end up with 3 detail processes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1100px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 64.72727272727272%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Review workflow architecture\"\n        title=\"Review workflow architecture\"\n        src=\"/static/b97920c73c32d2950cc6b65fc638f8a4/28a3f/review_workflow_architecture.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b97920c73c32d2950cc6b65fc638f8a4/88b8e/review_workflow_architecture.png 275w,\n/static/b97920c73c32d2950cc6b65fc638f8a4/8c3ad/review_workflow_architecture.png 550w,\n/static/b97920c73c32d2950cc6b65fc638f8a4/28a3f/review_workflow_architecture.png 1100w,\n/static/b97920c73c32d2950cc6b65fc638f8a4/ca756/review_workflow_architecture.png 1296w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>The scope of the campaign defines 3 repositories to review: Active Directory, Elyxo repository and Sage repository.\nThe ledger contains also the repository managers. A single person may manage several repositories.\nIn this example, Marc Vegas manages both Elyxo and Sage repositories while Paul Martin manages Active Directory.</p>\n<p>The role of the master process is to launch one detail sub-process by repository.\nMarc Vegas manages 2 repositories so he will have 2 tasks in his task list and when taking the task for Elyxo, only the accounts related to Elyxo will be displayed in the review page.</p>\n<p>The role of the detail sub-process is to send notifications to the reviewers and provide a task where they can decide what to do on each item.</p>\n<p>When both Paul Martin and Marc Vegas have finished their review, the master process can generate a compliance report containing\nall the decisions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scope\">Scope</h2>\n<p>When a review is started, the scope represents the list of items to review. The term 'scope' may have two meanings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>scope definition</li>\n<li>scope result list</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A scope definition is the business criteria used to select a part of the IT resources to review.\nFor example, a scope definition could be: all the privileged accounts having access to a financial application and having a discrepancy.\nThis looks like a query to filter accounts (or whatever will be reviewed)</p>\n<p>A scope result list is the extensive list of accounts that matches the scope definition.\nFor example, a scope result list could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CN=Domain Admin, CN=Users, DC=acme in ActiveDirectory</li>\n<li>root in LinFront</li>\n<li>SageAdmin in Sage</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"filtering-by-who-and-what\">Filtering by Who and What</h3>\n<p>A scope definition can also be seen as a matrix to match the 'Who' and the 'What'.\nLet's take the example of a right review by the organization managers.\nFor the 'What', we want only privileged accounts of financial applications (Sage and SAP for example).\nAnd for the 'Who', we want to target the managers of the 'Sales' division. Another review will take place later for the other organizations.</p>\n<p>The following schema shows how both dimensions (rights and organizations) are handled in the scope.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1100px; z-index: -1\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.18181818181819%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Review scope definition\"\n        title=\"Review scope definition\"\n        src=\"/static/bbdd83f190608135037214de6c7ae3b5/28a3f/review_scope_definition.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/bbdd83f190608135037214de6c7ae3b5/88b8e/review_scope_definition.png 275w,\n/static/bbdd83f190608135037214de6c7ae3b5/8c3ad/review_scope_definition.png 550w,\n/static/bbdd83f190608135037214de6c7ae3b5/28a3f/review_scope_definition.png 1100w,\n/static/bbdd83f190608135037214de6c7ae3b5/5040b/review_scope_definition.png 1468w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>This schema shows that the rights involved in this review are filtered using criteria like the kind of account and the application name.\nThe 'What' is reduced to a subset of the rights.\nOn the other hand, from the list of organizations, the campaign owner selects only the 'Sales' division.\nThe 'Who' is reduced to one organization.</p>\n<p>In a right review by organization, the organization manager can review only the rights belonging to the people working in the same organization.\nOnly for his team the manager knows if a right is OK or if it should be revoked.\nSo the next step is to combine the 'What' and the 'Who' to keep only the rights belonging to his team.\nThis is accomplished by the following filter:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For each right, the review finds the account and then the identity owning this right.</li>\n<li>From the identity, the review finds which organization the identity is working in.</li>\n<li>The rights are kept only if the organization matches the selected organizations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"filtering-by-rules\">Filtering by rules</h3>\n<p>The objective is to offer business filtering when launching a campaign.\nIn the campaign start page, a list of filters are available. Any combination of these filters can be selected.\nWhen the campaign is launched, the item list is reduced to the items belonging to one of these filters.</p>\n<p>When selecting multiple filters, the item are kept if they match at least one filter.</p>\n<p>The filters are implemented as rules in the Brainwave product which means that complex filtering is available.\nHere are some examples (from basic to sophisticated):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>accounts from the Elyxo repository</li>\n<li>accounts belonging to ActiveDirectory groups containing the word 'Admin'</li>\n<li>orphan accounts giving access to SAP</li>\n<li>active accounts belonging to an identity who has moved (job or organization) less that 3 month ago.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"scope-warning\">Scope warning</h3>\n<p>When combining the 'Who' and the 'What', there is a potential issue with the completeness.\nLet's continue with the previous example (right review by organization managers).</p>\n<p>When the review is at the step of combining the list of filtered rights with the selected organizations, some rights may be filtered out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The rights for orphan accounts. These rights have no owner and no organization. When matching the organizations, these rights are filtered out.</li>\n<li>The rights for people in no organization. When matching the organizations, these rights are also filtered out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These rights should be reviewed either in a specific review or in a specific case in the main review.\nAt the end of the day, as there is no organization, there is no manager to review these rights.\nIt means that this is a specific case where a reviewer should be assigned the task (it can be the campaign owner himself).</p>\n<h2 id=\"review-pages\">Review pages</h2>\n<p>The user interface for the manager has 2 modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a list of items to review with filtering and grouping facilities,</li>\n<li>a cross table to get a visual analysis of the scope to review.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both working modes are explained below in the next paragraphs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"list\">List</h3>\n<p>The list is the default presentation. Each line is an item to review.\nWith the example of a right review by organization managers, the item is a right so the line displays the information representing this right.\nThis could be the account, the identity owning it, the permission and the application.</p>\n<p>When an item is selected, details are shown in the right pane. This pane may contain one or more tabs, each one focusing on a different aspect.\nWith these details, the manager obtains the complete context (who has this right, what is his job, in which organization...) which is very important for the decision.</p>\n<p>To review item, the manager can select one or several items and click on an action button (accept, revoke, update...) and add a comment if needed.\nTo handle several items by category (for example, all rights of a given identity), the user interface offers a way to group lines using a column.</p>\n<p>The following screenshot shows the review list:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

It contains which manual task has been validated by who and at which date.</li>\n<li>TicketReview is used to store the decision for a given reviewed item.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the master process is started, it creates one TicketLog and one TicketAction representing respectively the process and the action of creating the process.\nThen the process creates several TicketReview to remember the scope in the 'Who'.\nIn a right review by organization manager, a TicketReview is created for each organization.</p>\n<p>The master process groups the organizations by managers and launches as many sub-processes as there are managers.</p>\n<p>Each sub-process starts by creating one TicketLog and one TicketAction representing respectively the sub-process and the manager manual task.\nWhen the manager has finished his review and validates his task, the TicketAction is updated with the name of the manager and the time of the task validation.\nThen the sub-process creates as many TicketReview as items in the scope. Each TicketReview contains the decision along with the comment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"time-based-events\">Time based events</h2>\n<p>There are several time based events occurring in the review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reminders</li>\n<li>escalation reminders</li>\n<li>due date</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reminders and the escalation reminders trigger emails to campaign candidates.\nThe number of reminders and the time between two reminders are customizable.\nAll the configuration details are given in the chapter explaining the editor tabs.</p>\n<p>The due date is entered by the campaign owner when he starts the campaign.\nThis due date is used to make all review tasks expire at the given date.\nAt this date, the candidates can no longer take the tasks (they are removed from their task list) and the whole campaign is finished.</p>\n<p>The due date is used to compute the reminders backward in time.\nFor example send 3 notification reminders with 5 business days between each one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"emails\">Emails</h2>\n<p>All the task notifications, the reminders and the escalation notifications are sent using emails.\nThese emails can be customized (change the title, the body, the attachments...) and nationalized (the identity language is used).\nThe following screenshot shows a notification email received by a manager:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
