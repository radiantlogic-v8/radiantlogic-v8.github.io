It is configurable through the separation of tasks,the separating of two sets of tasks. A task is a set of couples permission / application. There is one type of SoD control result: \"the inconsistencies\". The SoD controls are based on accounts or identifiers.

For example, some rights can be awarded to some users and not to others. Such controls can then compare the actually granted authorizations to those granted through a workflow process for example.</p>\n<p>Configuring a theoretical right control involves specifying the perimeter on which this control is applied, both in terms of population (identities) and permissions covered by associated applications. The control will thereby compare on the given perimeter the actually granted permissions to the \"theoretical\" ones in order to highlight the results lists.

The conditions for granting application/permission is loaded during the first data loading process (cf. collector line under the theoretical right target).
