If you want to launch a load in the sandbox, you will need to go through the launch menu in the collector lines editor to do so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"determining-active-identities\">Determining Active Identities</h2>\n<p>This step is optional.\nOne the data is loaded and activated, it is possible to identify the identities that have been loaded in the Ledger but are no longer part of the company.<br>\nThis operation can be of particular use when loading the data for the first time. It results in the valorization of the \"active\" Boolean attribute of the identified object.<br>\nThe identification of active identities is carried out with the help of an audit rule. This rule turns up all of the identities that are still part of the company. It is possible to make use of any data from within the Ledger in order to determine whether the identity is still part of the company.</p>\n<p>It is advisable to adopt the following strategy when loading identities into the Ledger:<br>\nOn the first data load, load all of the identities, including people who have already left the company. Ideally you should load the departure dates. If this is not possible because the information is not available load a \"flag\" to indicate if the person is still in the company or not. Set step 2 of the Execution Plan to identify active identities on the basis of this information.<br>\nDuring future loads, only load people who are still part of the company into the Ledger. In the collector lines, filter the people who are no longer part of the company (if this information is actually made available in the files).<br>\nThis allows the results of account reconciliation to be maximized during the first data load and afterwards to not pollute the Ledger and the analyses with false positives that in fact correspond to people who have left the company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"account-reconciliation\">Account Reconciliation</h2>\n<p>This step is mandatory.\nOnce the identities are marked as being active/inactive comes the step where the accounts are reconciled.<br>\nReconciling the accounts amounts to finding, for each account, the identity of the owner of the account. Reconciliation applies to all the \"orphan\" accounts, that is accounts on which no status is given (attaching an account to its owner, an ownerless account with a special status, etc.).<br>\nThis corresponds to executing an account reconciliation policy. This policy seeks to reconcile all of the orphan accounts.<br>\nAt the end the reconciliation policy execution, the change in cardinality status of the identities are updated. This corresponds to detecting changes in which accounts are attributed to people (attribute accountchanged on the identity object) and permissions are attributed (attribute permissionchanged on the identity object).</p>\n<p>It is standard for the reconciliation information to be retained between timeslots. In practice only new accounts and accounts that were not reconciled during the preceding timeslot are reconciled. For all the other accounts (including service accounts whether they are marked through the collect or through a reconciliation rule), the reconciliation status is carried over from the preceding timeslot.<br>\nA special situation can occur when an account was reconciled to a person and that person is no longer present in the current timeslot (because he or she has left the company). In this case, the reconciliation status of the account automatically becomes that of an \"ownerless account\", the reason for reconcilation becomes \"leaved\" and the description of the reconciliation contains the full name of the owner of the account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"manager-policy\">Manager Policy</h2>\n<p>This step is optional.\nThis step corresponds to the resolution of managerial links between a concept (identity, application, permission...) and the identity managing it when it is not possible to do so during the Collect phase.</p>\n<p>This corresponds to running a manager policy. This policy will seek to weave links between the concept and the identity that is in charge of this concept, using data collected during the previous parts of the Execution Plan.\nTo do so, it will execute one or severals manager rules.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theoretical-rights-model\">Theoretical Rights Model</h2>\n<p>This step is optional.\nThis step corresponds to the construction of theoretical rights on the basis of \"raw\" information that was loaded during the data collection.<br>\nThis corresponds to running a rights model policy. This policy will seek to weave links between identities and applicable entitlements on the basis of the available raw data. To do this, it will sequentially execute a series of model right rules.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rules\">Rules</h2>\n<p>This step is optional.\nThis step corresponds to running all the rules that were indicated as being part of the execution plan. The rules are executed and the results are saved in the Ledger in the active timeslot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"controls\">Controls</h2>\n<p>This step is optional.\nThis step corresponds to running all of the controls that were indicated as being part of the execution plan.<br>\nThe controls are executed and the results are saved in the Ledger in the active timeslot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"validation\">Validation</h2>\n<p>This step is mandatory.\nOnce all of the data is loaded, and the rules and controls carried out, it will be necessary to validate the timeslot so that all of the users can have access to it in the web portal.<br>\nThis operation can be carried out automatically by the execution plan, and this is particularly useful in cases where the loads are automated. In these cases, it is possible to set the integrity controls that are to be executed ahead of time when confirming the timeslot. These controls will proceed to comparisons between the data from the previous timeslot and the active data. Thresholds are also set either as absolute values or as a percentage. If at least one of the thresholds is reached, the data will not be automatically validated.<br>\nThis mechanism allows notably for quality concerns with the data to be tackled ahead of time (corrupt source files, etc.). If the load is carried out in \"batch\" mode, an email giving a summary of it will be sent to the Analytics administrator.<br>\nIt is also possible to not automatically validate the timeslot in the execution plan, but to carry out a manual validation within the \"Ledger\" interface in Analytics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"running-the-execution-plan\">Running the execution plan</h2>\n<p>Running the execution plan allows to execute all data loading steps in a new timeslot. Optionally automatic data validation can be carried out.<br>\nIf the execution plan is launched in batch mode, an email summarizing the operation can be automatically sent when the execution has been completed.<br>\nIt is also possible to carry out automatic maintenance operations on the data base at the time of each load. This corresponds to updating the base statistics. It is strongly recommended to choose this option as it allows performance of the data base to be maintained with each subsequent load.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"understanding-the-execution-plan"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Understanding the Execution
