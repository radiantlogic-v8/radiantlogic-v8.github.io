A validated timeslot is read only and as such validated data can no longer be changed in any way, nor is it possible to delete validated timeslots. This is due to high standards of traceability and integrity for the data, because:</li>\n<li>Data is used to consolidate customer flags and also action plans, which should not be developed after the fact, as these customer flags and action plans are intended to be used by operational teams;</li>\n<li>Third party auditors may require evidence that the data has not been deliberately misused within Brainwave Identity GRC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Validated timeslots are visible to all portal users.</p>\n<p>When multiple timeslots are validated successively, they may have one of two statuses, depending on the situation. The latest timeslot to be validated becomes the current timeslot. This is the timeslot that is used in the Portal and Analytics by default; other timeslots are given the old status, which means that they remain accessible in the Portal and Analytics if they are selected from the GUI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hidden-timeslots\">Hidden Timeslots</h3>\n<p>A hidden timeslot is a timeslot that has been deliberately hidden by the solution administrator. It may be useful to hide a timeslot if it contains multiple errors and is unusable in practice.</p>\n<p>It is not recommended to hide an old timeslot as time-based attributes are not recalculated (actionchanged, etc.) Reports that consolidated historic information may therefore generate inconsistent results. Hiding a timeslot is therefore only suitable for the current timeslot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dates-applicable-to-timeslots\">Dates Applicable to Timeslots</h3>\n<p>Each timeslot has multiple dates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data upload date: Corresponds to the date the sandbox was created</li>\n<li>Data activation date: Corresponds to the date the timeslot was activated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These dates are available in the Identity Ledger, by selecting the \"Views\" from the timeslot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"timeslot-summary\">Timeslot Summary</h3>\n<p>The diagram below summarizes the various statuses possible for timeslots.
