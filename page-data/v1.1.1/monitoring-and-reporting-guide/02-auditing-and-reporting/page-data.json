RadiantOne includes three default types of basic reports:\r\nAccess, Audit and Group Audit. This section describes the report settings, content of these\r\nreports, and recommendations on report usage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recommendations-for-auditing-and-reporting\">Recommendations for Auditing and Reporting</h2>\n<p>There are four recommendations for auditing and reporting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To analyze/debug a problem</li>\n<li>To periodically monitor the health of the RadiantOne service</li>\n<li>To audit client activity of RadiantOne (who is connecting, doing what, and when)</li>\n<li>To audit configuration changes to RadiantOne</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following sections describe each recommendation in more details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE - The scenarios provided below are general guidelines and entirely optional. You should generate reports as often as required for your deployment.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"analyzing-problems\">Analyzing Problems</h3>\n<p>If consumers of the RadiantOne service are experiencing problems (time-consuming logins, expected information not being returned...etc.), the access report can be helpful in pinpointing\r\nwhat is happening on the server and diagnosing the problem.</p>\n<p>The instructions in this section assume the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The RadiantOne server log level has been set to a minimum of Info.</li>\n<li>The access log content is relevant (captures the period of time where consumers are seeing issues).</li>\n<li>All operations are configured to be included in the report.</li>\n<li>RadiantOne is configured to log to CSV (on the Settings Tab > Logs section > Server Logs, make sure the CSV Output format option is checked on the right side).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"starting-the-log-to-database-utility\">Starting the Log to Database Utility</h4>\n<p>The Log2DB settings can be managed from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Reporting Section > Log2DB Settings sub-section.</p>\n<p>After confirming the proper configuration, start the Log2DB Utility. On Windows platforms,\r\nexecute &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/bin/runAccessLog2DB.bat <path to AccessLog2DBconfig.properties\r\nfile>. On UNIX platforms, execute runAccessLog2DB.sh <path to\r\nAccessLog2DBconfig.properties file>. The AccessLog2DBconfig.properties file is in\r\n&#x3C;RLI_HOME>/config/log2db.</p>\n<p>The Log2DB utility writes the access log information into a database. After, generate the Access\r\nReport from the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Reporting section -> Access Log Report\r\nsub-section. On the right side, click on the Generate Report button. The report can be found in\r\nthe location indicated in the Output Location parameter which is &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/reporting-\r\nbirt/reports by default. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, you can generate a single report\r\nthat aggregates statistics from all nodes in the cluster. For more information on configuring and\r\ngenerating an Access Log report, see <a href=\"#access-log-report-settings\">Access Log Report Settings</a> and <a href=\"#access-log-report\">Access Log Report</a>.</p>\n<p>The summary section provides you with valuable information regarding how long operations are\r\ntaking and a summary of error codes found. In the detailed section of the report, you will find\r\nspecific entries from the log that match either a certain error code and/or exceed a response\r\ntime threshold. This information can be the starting point for further investigation and pinpoints\r\nthe location in the access log (by searching for the exact connection and operation numbers\r\nassociated with a specific operation) where the issue occurred. Sometimes, examining the\r\nactivity prior to an error can help in determining the cause of a problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"monitoring-the-health-of-the-radiantone-service\">Monitoring the Health of the RadiantOne Service</h3>\n<p>It is typically recommended to monitor the health of the RadiantOne service over a one week period at least once a month. Pay close attention to the configured access log rotation schedule\r\nto ensure no log content is missed (if applicable for your reports). The access log can be configured to roll over based on a configured size.</p>\n<p>At the end of the reporting period, you can generate the Access Report from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Reporting section > Access Log Report sub-section. On the right side,\r\nclick the Generate Report button. The report can be found in the location indicated in the Output Location parameter which is &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/reporting-birt/reports by default.</p>\n<p>The summary section provides you with valuable information regarding how long operations are\r\ntaking and a summary of error codes found. If these numbers are not as expected, they may\r\nindicate areas where tuning is required. In the detailed section of the report, you will find specific\r\nentries from the log that match either a certain error code and/or exceed a response time\r\nthreshold. With this information, you can search the exact log file location for more information\r\nabout the request that exceeded the response time. For example, if search operations are\r\nconsistently slow to respond against a certain branch in the RadiantOne namespace this could\r\nindicate that a cache should be configured for this branch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"auditing-radiantone-configuration-changes\">Auditing RadiantOne Configuration Changes</h3>\n<p>To log configuration changes made through command line, using the vdsconfig utility, enable\r\nconfig logging with the following steps:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE – these steps require downtime since all services must be stopped. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, perform the following steps on each node.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Stop all RadiantOne services including ZooKeeper.</li>\n<li>Edit &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\config\\advanced\\features.properties and set:\r\nvdsconfig.logging.enabled=true</li>\n<li>Restart ZooKeeper.</li>\n<li>Restart all needed RadiantOne services.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Configuration changes are logged in: &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/logs/vdsconfig.log</p>\n<h3 id=\"auditing-radiantone-client-activity\">Auditing RadiantOne Client Activity</h3>\n<p>It is typically recommended to audit RadiantOne client activity over a one-week period at least once a month.</p>\n<p>Pay close attention to the configured access log rotation schedule to ensure no log content is missed (if applicable for your reports). The access log may be configured to roll over based on a\r\nconfigured size.</p>\n<p>You can generate the Audit Report from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Reporting section > Audit Report sub-section. On the right side, click the Generate Report button. The\r\nreport can be found in the location indicated in the Output Location parameter which is &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/reporting-birt/reports by default. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, you can\r\ngenerate a single report that aggregates statistics from all nodes in the cluster. For more information on configuring and generating an audit report, see <a href=\"#audit-report-settings\">Audit Report Settings</a> and <a href=\"#audit-report\">Audit Report</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\">**IMPORTANT NOTE – you can also audit user activity and have the report sorted by</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>groups. The <a href=\"#group-audit-report\">Group Audit Report</a> is similar in output to the Audit Report. The only difference being the report categorizes user activity based on groups.**</p>\n<p>The session information is listed at the top of a section followed by the user DN that performed\r\nthe operations. Next to the user DN is a table consisting of all types of operations performed by\r\nthe user in addition to the total number of times that type of operation was performed. This\r\ninformation allows you to monitor who is accessing the RadiantOne service and when, in\r\naddition to what operations they are performing. This can help pinpoint undesirable access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maintaining-the-log-database\">Maintaining the Log Database</h3>\n<p>It is important to note that there is no built-in maintenance of the log database. The database\r\nadministrator responsible for the database chosen to store the log content should maintain the\r\ndatabase table as needed (the amount of log content stored in the database depends on\r\nfrequency the Log2DB utility is run and the activity against RadiantOne). This includes things\r\nlike sizing the table properly for log history it should store, clearing the old log content from the\r\ntable when it is no longer needed...etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note – For assistance with establishing log maintenance and a reporting program, please contact Radiant Logic for professional services.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"configuration\">Configuration</h2>\n<p>The reports are built on top of the capability of RadiantOne to store the access log content into a\r\ndatabase table. RadiantOne uses a separate utility named Log2DB to log into a database. There are four configuration settings that need to be considered. The <a href=\"#log2db-settings\">Log2DB settings</a>, the <a href=\"#access-log-report-settings\">Access Report settings</a>, the <a href=\"#audit-report-settings\">Audit Report settings</a>, and the <a href=\"#group-audit-report-settings\">Group Audit Report settings</a>. These are described in this section.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\">**IMPORTANT NOTE – the database associated with the Log2DB settings must be</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>running in order start the Log2DB Utility.**</p>\n<h3 id=\"log2db-settings\">Log2DB Settings</h3>\n<p>The database that houses the table which contains the RadiantOne access log content may be in any database server you choose. The default settings leverage a Derby database that is\r\nincluded with RadiantOne. These settings are described below and are located on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Reporting section > <a href=\"#log2db-settings\">Log2DB Settings</a> sub-section.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\">**IMPORTANT NOTE – if you plan on using the RadiantOne <a href=\"#generating-reports\">default report generation</a>,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>then the log2db database must be Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Derby or PostgreSQL.**</p>\n<p>The default configuration file for logging to a database is:\r\n&#x3C;RLI_HOME>/config/log2db/AccessLog2DBconfig.properties</p>\n<p>This properties file contains the connection information to the database where you want to store\r\nthe log table and the settings are described below.</p>\n<p>Database Settings\r\nThe following settings are related to the database that stores the table containing the access log\r\ncontents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Database Datasource</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>The name of the data source associated with the database server that will store the log content.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Table Name</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>The table name that will store the log contents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mode (either Truncate or Append)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>When you start the log process, if you are in truncate mode, it empties the contents of the log table before anything new gets added.

The contents of each section are described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary Section</strong></p>\n<p>The summary appears first and starts off with two tables. The first table indicates the types of operations received by RadiantOne and the total number per operation. The second table indicates the various result codes that appear throughout the report, their meaning and the\r\nnumber of times they appear. These tables are followed by sections dedicated for each type of operation (bind, base searches, one level searches, sub tree searches, add, modify, delete, and compare).
