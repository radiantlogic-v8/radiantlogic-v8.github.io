One data source may use an encryption scheme that is not understood by another data source. Therefore, the only way to synchronize passwords between the two sources would be to capture the password in clear text before the data source encrypts it. RadiantOne offers a password filter component that captures a password in clear text when it is created or reset and publishes the password to other data sources that need this information. The password filter component is available for Active Directory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"configuring-password-synchronization-topology\">Configuring Password Synchronization Topology</h2>\n<h3 id=\"configuring-the-synchronization-topology\">Configuring the Synchronization Topology</h3>\n<p>The first step in configuring password synchronization is to capture the schema and connection information from the Active Directory (where the password filter will be listening for changes) and all data stores that will receive the password changes. For help on capturing schemas, please see the RadiantOne Context Builder Guide.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE – If the destination/target receiving the password changes is an Active Directory, the target connector must connect to this Active Directory via SSL. For details on how to connect to a data source via SSL, please see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Next, configure the synchronization source and target using the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab and then the needed topology using the Global Sync tab. The topology should be for password synchronization only because the capture/source connector type must be set as type AD Password Filter and this connector type can only be used for synchronizing password changes. In other words, even if you already have a topology that contains your Active Directory source object where you are already detecting changes from (inserts, updates, deletes), you should create a new topology that is solely for password synchronization.</p>\n<p>The topology should consist of the user object from the Active Directory schema (as the source) and all other objects that should receive the password change (as targets). Each target requires a separate topology. For example, if Active Directory passwords need to be synchronized to Target Directory 1 and Target Directory 2, one topology will process the password sync from Active Directory to Target Directory 1 and one topology will process the password sync from Active Directory to Target Directory 2. The flow of change should come from the user object (representing the source where the password filter will be listening for changes) and be directed toward the other target object in the topology. In the transformation script, you must set the password attribute from the source user object to the correct destination attribute. The source and target attribute mapping should be userPassword. For help on configuring a topology, please see the RadiantOne Global Sync Guide.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>**Note – you will need the name of the synchronization object for the password filter configuration. For the password filter configuration, the synchronization</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>object is the DN in the RadiantOne namespace that is the parent container for the source Active Directory users. In the example shown below, the sync object is o=adsource.**</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 549px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/762a0abd7a8abe80b77428d342cbfbc2/588f6/topologies.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 20.858895705521473%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/762a0abd7a8abe80b77428d342cbfbc2/588f6/topologies.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/762a0abd7a8abe80b77428d342cbfbc2/d2f63/topologies.jpg 163w,\n/static/762a0abd7a8abe80b77428d342cbfbc2/c989d/topologies.jpg 325w,\n/static/762a0abd7a8abe80b77428d342cbfbc2/588f6/topologies.jpg 549w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"setting-the-capture-connector-type\">Setting the Capture Connector Type</h3>\n<p>The Active Directory source object should be set for the password filter.

The filter then publishes the information to a log file where it remains until the password service retrieves it. The log file is read by the password service (Radiant Logic, Inc. Change Password Filter Service). The password service uses the hostname, port, syncobject and userattribute parameters that were configured for the password filter to send the password changes to the connector (which is listening on a dedicated port to receive the changes). The connector then publishes the information to the targets/destinations that have been configured to subscribe to password changes (as defined in the synchronization topology). If the password service cannot reach the connector (i.e. it is not running) to publish the password change, it continues to try indefinitely.</p>\n<p>See diagram below for a high-level architecture.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d0fb1bd3fc321d0b629a89e9d261f11b/a3695/Image6.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 20.858895705521473%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/d0fb1bd3fc321d0b629a89e9d261f11b/a3695/Image6.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d0fb1bd3fc321d0b629a89e9d261f11b/d2f63/Image6.jpg 163w,\n/static/d0fb1bd3fc321d0b629a89e9d261f11b/c989d/Image6.jpg 325w,\n/static/d0fb1bd3fc321d0b629a89e9d261f11b/a3695/Image6.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 6: Password Synchronization Architecture</p>\n<h3 id=\"troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting</h3>\n<p>On the machine where the password filter is installed, there is a folder named RadiantOne_PWDCHANGES located in C:\\Windows\\System32.

The password service uses the hostname, port, syncobject and userattribute parameters that were configured for the password filter to send the password changes to the connector (which is listening on a dedicated port to receive the changes). The connector then publishes the information to the targets/destinations that have been configured to subscribe to password changes (as defined in the synchronization topology).
