If you received license keys for each node/server, each RadiantOne node in a cluster must have its own unique license key. If you received a license key that is valid for a cluster, each node in a given/same cluster can share the same key value. Check with your Radiant Logic Account Representative if you are unsure what kind of license key you received.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replacing-single-node-license-keys-with-new-single-node-license-keys\">Replacing Single Node License Keys with New Single Node License Keys</h3>\n<p>This scenario assumes you currently have a RadiantOne cluster deployed, each node in the cluster has its own unique license key, and you want to replace the single node license keys\r\nwith new single node license keys. The following are the replacement steps whether the license key has expired or not.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On one RadiantOne node, open the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/license.lic file in a text editor and replace the entire key value with your new license key and save the file. The key value should start with {rlib}. Make sure there are no extra leading or trailing spaces. Save the license.lic file. Make sure no extra extensions (e.g. .txt) have been added to the file.</li>\n<li>Restart the RadiantOne service on the node. The new license key value gets registered in ZooKeeper once the service is restarted. Confirm that the RadiantOne service has restarted before continuing to step 3.</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 1-2 on each RadiantOne cluster node.
