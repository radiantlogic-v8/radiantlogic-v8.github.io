Joins configured in RadiantOne can be either across objects from the same backend data source or objects from different backend data sources.  Each of these is described in more details below.</p>\n<h4 id=\"joins-between-heterogeneous-sources\">Joins Between Heterogeneous Sources</h4>\n<p>There are two types of joins possible to configure in the View Designer. One type is known as a regular join and the other is an extended join. Each is described below.</p>\n<h5 id=\"regular-join\">Regular Join</h5>\n<p>Use a Regular Join to add existing attribute(s) from another data source(s) to a virtual entry.</p>\n<p>The starting point for the join is known as the primary (or base/main) object. The data sources to be joined are known as secondary objects. Any object in the RadiantOne namespace can be a primary or secondary object. Entries representing the same user across all data sources must have a unique identifier (common key) in order to configure a regular join (a computed attribute may also be used to base a join on if more than one attribute is required to establish the common unique identifier). In the diagram below, the LDAP directory has been joined with Active Directory and a database based on a common value of employeeID matching employeeNumber in Active Directory and Emp_ID in the database.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 482px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0cb142434d9587b42ff3adf411c98808/05b37/Image2.2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 53.37423312883436%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/0cb142434d9587b42ff3adf411c98808/05b37/Image2.2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0cb142434d9587b42ff3adf411c98808/d2f63/Image2.2.jpg 163w,\n/static/0cb142434d9587b42ff3adf411c98808/c989d/Image2.2.jpg 325w,\n/static/0cb142434d9587b42ff3adf411c98808/05b37/Image2.2.jpg 482w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.2: Regular Join Example</p>\n<h5 id=\"configuring-a-regular-join-with-objects-existing-in-another-virtual-view\">Configuring a Regular Join with Objects Existing in another Virtual View</h5>\n<p>To configure a join, the virtual view built from the primary source must be open in the View Designer perspective.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>With the virtual view opened on the View Designer tab, navigate to the primary object in the view definition (defined as either a Container or Content node) and, under the Node Properties tab on the right side, select the Object tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Join Profiles section, click New.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select Regular join type and click Next.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the Join with Existing View type of association.

This is primarily used to accommodate the storage of application-specific attributes. In the case of an extended join, the RadiantOne service handles the creation and management of the new attributes. The new attributes are stored in the RadiantOne namespace (either in a local Universal Directory store or some other backend that is represented in the namespace). The RadiantOne service joins the primary/main entries with these extended attributes as well as handles any modifications to these attributes accordingly (update, delete…etc.).</p>\n<p>The diagram below depicts an extended join. AuthzCode, lastLogon, and pwdreset are the application-specific extension attributes that are stored in RadiantOne.  RadiantOne manages the lifecycle (creation, modification, deletion) of these entries/attributes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 476px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/17c35b2af4c2a38ec25b277f628c7dbc/16c42/Image2.3.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 44.171779141104295%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/17c35b2af4c2a38ec25b277f628c7dbc/16c42/Image2.3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/17c35b2af4c2a38ec25b277f628c7dbc/d2f63/Image2.3.jpg 163w,\n/static/17c35b2af4c2a38ec25b277f628c7dbc/c989d/Image2.3.jpg 325w,\n/static/17c35b2af4c2a38ec25b277f628c7dbc/16c42/Image2.3.jpg 476w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.3: Extended Join Example</p>\n<p>When you configure the extended join, there are two settings you can choose from for storing the extension attributes.

This is a hidden naming context and is not seen when clients browse the root naming contexts. Hidden naming contexts are prefixed with the keyword hiddenContexts in the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/conf/rootdse.ldif file.</p>\n<p>The entries are created automatically, and the extension attributes are added, updated and deleted based on client requests. The only parameters to configure when using the default settings are the object class you want associated with the extension attributes, and the attribute names.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Custom – if this is chosen, RadiantOne stores the extension attributes in the location of your choice. The location must first exist (create it in the RadiantOne namespace if you haven’t already). RadiantOne manages the creation of the entries and attributes as well as all modifications to these entries. The parameters you must configure are the target base DN (the location in the RadiantOne namespace where you want to store the extension attributes), the object class to associate the extension attributes with, and how to comprise the RDN attribute (name and attribute from the source to populate the target RDN with).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE – if your chosen location in the RadiantOne namespace is configured as something other than a local Universal Directory (HDAP) store, then the underlying backend must be capable of storing the extension attributes.

The numeric value set after the attribute indicates the precedence level (0 being least authoritative, 255 being most authoritative. If no value is specified, an authority level of 128 is assumed). For more information, please see the section titled <a href=\"#attribute-priority\">Attribute Priority</a>.</p>\n<p>A sub level search scope is specified to find the objects to join.</p>\n<p>The join takes place when uid from the ou=people,o=myviews branch matches the CID attribute in the base source.</p>\n<p>##JOINTYPE=INNER is set to specify that only primary entries that have a matching entry in a secondary source should be returned in the result.  Primary entries that do not have a matching entry are not returned.  The options for jointype are INNER and LEFT.  With LEFT join type, all entries from the primary source are returned. If the primary entry has a matching entry in a secondary source, those additional attributes comprise the virtual entry.</p>\n<p>##SIZELIMIT=1 is set to specify only one entry should be returned to join with.  In this case, it is assumed that only one entry should be returned from the ou=people,o=myviews branch for each primary entry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE - If no sizelimit is specified, the default used is 1000.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example 2 – Regular Join</strong></p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>LDAP://198.123.123.444:389/dc=anotherldap,dc=com?sub?(&(sn=@[LASTNAME])(givenname=@[FIRSTNAME]))##USERID=cn=directorymanager##PASSWORD=secret##SIZELIMIT=1 </codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">LDAP://198.123.123.444:389/dc=anotherldap,dc=com?sub?(&amp;(sn=@[LASTNAME])(givenname=@[FIRSTNAME]))##USERID=cn=directorymanager##PASSWORD=secret##SIZELIMIT=1 </code></pre></div>\n<p>The IP address shown here indicates the server that you want to join to (also known as the secondary source).</p>\n<p>The dc=anotherldap,dc=com section specifies the branch (target base dn) in that server that contains the objects to be joined.</p>\n<p>Since no attributes are listed, all attributes from the secondary source are returned by default.</p>\n<p>A sub level search scope is specified to find the secondary objects to join.</p>\n<p>The join takes place when sn matches LASTNAME and givenName matches FIRSTNAME.</p>\n<p>##USERID specifies the user to connect to the server (198.123.123.444).\r\n##PASSWORD specifies the password for the user mentioned above.</p>\n<p>##SIZELIMIT=1 is set to specify only one entry should be returned to join with.

The default behavior of RadiantOne is to return a multi-valued attribute if a secondary object returns an attribute with the same name as the primary/main object (as long as the values are different). If you do not want the attribute to return as a multi-value, you can set a priority for the attributes. The default priority level set for all attributes is normal.  From the interface, you would use the priority levels shown below. The corresponding numeric values are also shown and would only be used if you edit the condition manually.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Priority Level</th>\n<th>Numeric Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Lowest</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>64</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>128</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>192</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Highest</td>\n<td>255</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To specify attribute priority, open the virtual view containing the primary/main objects and select the associated container or content level. On the right side select the Object tab. Here, you should see the entire list of attributes coming from the primary object, returned from any joined/secondary objects, and any computed attributes. Select the attribute name that has more than one source and then click <strong>Edit Attribute</strong>. The details for the attribute are shown. The origin of the attribute shows all sources the attribute comes from. Click in the Priority column to set the priority accordingly. The attribute with the higher priority is returned in the virtual entry.</p>\n<p>In addition to setting priority, you can also specify whether the attributes returned from joined sources are hidden (not visible in the virtual entry), searchable, or updateable.</p>\n<h5 id=\"marking-attributes-as-hidden\">Marking Attributes as Hidden</h5>\n<p>You may want to define an attribute as hidden because you need it for a join (it may be the attribute you are basing your join on), but you don’t want the value to be in the final joined entry.</p>\n<p>To define an attribute as hidden, select the Object tab (for the appropriate container or content node) and select the attribute you want to hide. Click <strong>Edit Attribute</strong> and check the Hidden in Result box. These attributes are not returned in the joined entry.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 479px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/77633221ea91723b4d1a23d8155e43e6/1194c/Image2.7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.828220858895705%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/77633221ea91723b4d1a23d8155e43e6/1194c/Image2.7.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/77633221ea91723b4d1a23d8155e43e6/d2f63/Image2.7.jpg 163w,\n/static/77633221ea91723b4d1a23d8155e43e6/c989d/Image2.7.jpg 325w,\n/static/77633221ea91723b4d1a23d8155e43e6/1194c/Image2.7.jpg 479w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.7: Marking Attribute as Hidden</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE – if you edit the join condition manually, and want to make an attribute returned from a joined object hidden, add a value of 1792 to the priority weight you have set. For example, if mail were an attribute returned from a join and you had it set with a priority value of 128 (NORMAL), then to make it hidden in the virtual entry, you would change the numeric value to be 1920 (128 + 1792). Mail:1920 is how it would appear in the join condition if you were to edit the join manually.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Making Attributes Searchable</p>\n<p>You may define attributes as searchable or not.  If an attribute from a joined source is defined as searchable, and a client uses the attribute in a search filter, RadiantOne attempts the join on all entries from the primary source and then applies the filter to see which ones match the client search filter.</p>\n<p>If an attribute from a secondary source is defined as non-searchable, RadiantOne applies the search filter on the primary objects (to narrow down the possible join candidates) and then only joins those entries.

(128 + 512 + 1024).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"how-the-join-is-performed\">How the Join is Performed</h4>\n<p>If the filter in the client search involves attribute(s) that come from the primary (main) source only, RadiantOne pre-filters (applies that filter to the primary entries to reduce the number of entries that are required to join). If the filter in the client search involves attributes that can come from secondary (joined) sources and those attributes(s) are marked as searchable, then RadiantOne cannot pre-filter on those attributes and must join everything first and then apply the filter on the joined result. RadiantOne knows if attributes used in the filter could come from secondary sources if the attribute(s) are specifically requested in the join condition, or if * is used in the join condition to return everything from the joined source.</p>\n<p>If you require the attributes from the secondary sources to be searchable (used in a filter from a client search), you must specify them as such. If the filter received in the search contains any attributes that are defined as searchable from a secondary source, then RadiantOne does not pre-filter against the primary source for those attributes. The join is first performed (all entries are joined), and then the filter is applied on the result. For example, let’s say you have a backend pointing to a Sun Java Directory and you want to join with a virtual view of Active Directory. The following join condition could be defined:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>LDAP://[VDS]/dv=activedirectory,o=vds?sAMAccountName,objectclass,cn:640?one?(emplo yeeID=@[employeeNumber:VARCHAR(255)]) </codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">LDAP://[VDS]/dv=activedirectory,o=vds?sAMAccountName,objectclass,cn:640?one?(emplo yeeID=@[employeeNumber:VARCHAR(255)]) </code></pre></div>\n<p>Since cn is listed in the join condition as searchable (numeric value of 640), RadiantOne knows that it should apply the filter after first joining the entries. The Sun entries are joined with the Active Directory entries (where employeeNumber=employeeID) and then the filter is applied to the result. Performance is slower if you want attributes from joined sources to be searchable (because of the requirement to first join all entries).</p>\n<p>However, if a filter also contains an attribute that is only defined in the main source (and not listed in any join condition), RadiantOne applies the filter on the main set of entries to reduce the number that needs to be joined. Then, the reduced number of entries is joined and the filter is applied on the joined result.</p>\n<p>For example, using the join condition defined above, if RadiantOne receives a filter like: (&#x26;(mail=<a href=\"mailto:lcallahan@rli.com\">lcallahan@rli.com</a>)(cn=laura callahan)), it first searches the Sun Java Directory for entries matching mail=<a href=\"mailto:lcallahan@rli.com\">lcallahan@rli.com</a> (because mail is not defined as an attribute to return from Active Directory). Then, it joins the entries that were returned with the corresponding entries in Active Directory. Finally, it applies the original filter on the joined entries and the ones that match are returned to the client. The final result sent back to the client depends on whether your join configured is set for a Left or Inner join. Each are described below.</p>\n<h4 id=\"join-types\">Join Types</h4>\n<h5 id=\"left-join\">Left Join</h5>\n<p>In a Left Join, all entries from the primary source are returned in the result and if they have a matching entry in a secondary source(s), those additional attributes comprise the main entry. If an entry in the primary source does not have a matching entry in a joined source it is still a possible candidate to be returned to the client (if it matches the original filter in the client request).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 354px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/255c1f3942b1d3a229923a7f432e4fbb/e1632/Image2.10.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 73.61963190184049%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/255c1f3942b1d3a229923a7f432e4fbb/e1632/Image2.10.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/255c1f3942b1d3a229923a7f432e4fbb/d2f63/Image2.10.jpg 163w,\n/static/255c1f3942b1d3a229923a7f432e4fbb/c989d/Image2.10.jpg 325w,\n/static/255c1f3942b1d3a229923a7f432e4fbb/e1632/Image2.10.jpg 354w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.10: Example of a Left Join</p>\n<h5 id=\"inner-join\">Inner Join</h5>\n<p>In an Inner Join, the primary entries (from the starting point for the join) are joined with matching secondary objects.

If one of the secondary backend sources is down, RadiantOne does not know in this case because the optimization indicates that it should only join if necessary, and in this example, a join is not necessary. Therefore, RadiantOne does not know if a secondary backend is down or not.  In this situation, the entry (with the specific attributes requested) is returned to the client. If the filter in the client request involves attributes that could come from a secondary source (and they are configured as searchable), or if the requested attributes from the client include attributes from secondary sources(s), the optimization is not possible and RadiantOne must join. In this case, the default behavior is to not return the entry at all. If the client issued a base search, they receive LDAP error code 32 along with the error message from the secondary backend that was unavailable. If the client issued a one level or subtree search, they receive error code 9 along with the error message from the secondary backend that failed.</p>\n<p>If you would prefer RadiantOne to return partial entries, then you must specifically indicate this in the external join condition. Manually edit the join condition and add the following:</p>\n<p>##ALLOW_PARTIAL_ENTRY=yes</p>\n<p>If partial entries are allowed, and the client issued a base search, they receive LDAP error code 0 (no error) along with the partial entry (whatever information RadiantOne was able to retrieve from available sources). Each returned entry contains an additional attribute of vsyspartialentry=true. If the client issued a one level or subtree search, they receive LDAP error code 9 along with the partial entry (whatever information RadiantOne was able to retrieve from available sources) and an error message from the secondary backend that was unavailable.

If all sources fail, the client receives a bind failure error from RadiantOne.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 477px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f59295a91254ebd8fa61942122cf92d0/b18ba/Image2.13.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 58.282208588957054%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/f59295a91254ebd8fa61942122cf92d0/b18ba/Image2.13.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f59295a91254ebd8fa61942122cf92d0/d2f63/Image2.13.jpg 163w,\n/static/f59295a91254ebd8fa61942122cf92d0/c989d/Image2.13.jpg 325w,\n/static/f59295a91254ebd8fa61942122cf92d0/b18ba/Image2.13.jpg 477w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 2.13: Bind Order Example</p>\n<p>To configure the bind order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Have the virtual view built from the primary/main source open in the View Designer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the primary/main object in the view definition (represented as a container or content) and click on the Object tab on the right side.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click Edit next to the Define Bind Strategy property at the bottom.

If you are a customer and do not have access, please contact <a href=\"mailto:support@radiantlogic.com\">support@radiantlogic.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Default Behavior</strong></p>\n<p>All operations performed by RadiantOne (authentication, update, insert, delete, search) can have custom logic applied with interception scripts. The following section describes the default behavior for processing authentication, select, update, delete and insert requests. If you require additional capability, an interception script may be used.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note – consult with a Radiant Logic Support Engineer or Solution Architect to discuss any interception scripts you need.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Authentication</strong></p>\n<p>If the backend is a JDBC-accessible source, RadiantOne compares the password received in the bind request to the attribute that has been mapped to ‘userPassword’ in the virtual view from the database.  If the values match, the user is authenticated.  If the values do not match, then the user is not authenticated.</p>\n<p>If the backend is an LDAP (JNDI) accessible source, then RadiantOne delegates the bind request to the underlying directory. This process includes the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The user configured in the connection string (data source) of the virtual view definition file (.dvx file) is used to create a connection to the LDAP backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A search for the user who requested the bind operation is performed and the user’s DN is returned.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne issues the bind request to the underlying directory (using the DN returned from the search request) along with the password received in the bind request.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The three steps described above are transparent to the client that originally sent the bind request. The bind response (either successful or unsuccessful) is returned to RadiantOne from the backend, and then the RadiantOne service replies to the client. After the bind, the operations that the user is allowed to perform are configured in the Access Control Lists (ACL) within RadiantOne. This is only part of the authorization process (the first layer). Any operation that the user performs must also be allowed to be performed on the underlying directory with the user configured in the connection string/data source (the second layer). For example, if the user who binds successfully is allowed to change phone numbers (based on ACLs set up in RadiantOne), then the user configured in the data source associated with the virtual view definition must also be allowed to change phone numbers (based on ACLs set up in the underlying directory). For more information on setting access controls for RadiantOne, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.</p>\n<p><strong>Select</strong></p>\n<p>The requested entry is retrieved from the underlying source(s). The entry contains the attributes specified in the view definition and translated based on the configured mappings before it is returned to the client.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n<p>The update request is forwarded to the underlying source. The attribute(s) that the client is requesting to update must be available in the virtual entry (specified in the view definition) and updateable in the underlying data store. It is assumed that the attribute to be updated resides in a single underlying store.</p>\n<p><strong>Delete</strong></p>\n<p>The delete request is forwarded to the underlying source. The entry to be deleted must have a valid DN in the RadiantOne namespace. The entry that the client is requesting to delete must also be allowed to be removed from the backend data store, and only affect a single underlying object (i.e. only needs to be deleted from one database table or one entry in an LDAP directory).</p>\n<p><strong>Insert</strong></p>\n<p>The insert request is forwarded to the underlying source. The entry to be inserted must only affect one underlying source (i.e. one database table or a single location in a directory).  All attributes that are required by the underlying source must be included in the new entry.  The required attributes are specified in the schema that is captured by the Schema Manager. If you open the schema (.orx file) in the Schema Manager and select the Fields node (for a specific object) the Nullable column on the right indicates which attributes are required. Attributes that have false in the Nullable column are required.  Attributes that have true in the Nullable column are optional.</p>\n<p>The following sections describe how to enable and customize interception scripts if you need to override the default behavior detailed above.</p>\n<h4 id=\"enabling-an-interception-script\">Enabling an Interception Script</h4>\n<p>To create an interception script:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Have the virtual view opened on the View Designer tab.

In the View Designer, select the node in the view definition that represents the object a script is enabled for.  Select the Node Properties -> Advanced Settings sub-tab on the right side and uncheck all active operations.  Save the view. To “reactivate” the script, just check the Active checkboxes again and save the view.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hierarchy-builder\">Hierarchy Builder</h3>\n<p>The hierarchy builder utility builds a hierarchical virtual view based on attributes of an object.  Attributes from any object extracted using the Schema Manager can be used to build a hierarchical virtual view (as long as all entries have a value for this attribute). This is an easy way to turn a relatively flat LDAP directory tree or a database table into a hierarchical structure.  Having a hierarchical view can be useful for delegated administration.</p>\n<p>The following example describes how the hierarchy builder works. This example builds a virtual hierarchy based on attributes available in the LDAP object class inetOrgPerson.</p>\n<p>An LDAP directory contains an object class named inetOrgPerson. All user accounts are created with this object class. A sample entry is shown below.</p>\n<p>dn: uid=SBuchanan,ou=People,dc=domain1,dc=com\r\n<br>givenName: Steve\r\n<br>telephoneNumber: 111-111-5000\r\n<br>sn: Buchanan\r\n<br>mail: <a href=\"mailto:stevebuchanan@rli.net\">stevebuchanan@rli.net</a>\r\n<br>carLicense: CX4398\r\n<br>objectClass: top\r\n<br>objectClass: person\r\n<br>objectClass: organizationalPerson\r\n<br>objectClass: inetorgperson\r\n<br>uid: SBuchanan\r\n<br>postalCode: 94954\r\n<br>cn: Steve Buchanan\r\n<br>title: big sales guy\r\n<br>employeeNumber: 26568\r\n<br>description: This is the description for Steve Buchanan\r\n<br>businessCategory: Sales</p>\n<p>The LDAP directory has a flat structure with all user accounts located below ou=People,dc=domain1,dc=com.
