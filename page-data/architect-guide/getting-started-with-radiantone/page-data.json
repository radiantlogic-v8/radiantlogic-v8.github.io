RadiantOne comes equipped with not only an arsenal of advanced configuration tools to solve the most complex of cases, but also a set of wizards to help you get started in solving some of the most common problems that our customers encounter. This chapter provides a high-level overview of the RadiantOne administration consoles. The identity service wizards are also discussed along with guidance to help determine which will meet your needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"control-panels\">Control Panels</h2>\n<p>The RadiantOne Control Panels are web-based interfaces to provide remote access to the most commonly used tools and wizards.

These tasks can be viewed and updated in the task list section of the Tasks tab. You can define a task as re-occurring in addition to setting to execution interval. You can also configure the task to run inside a dedicated JVM and specify any custom JVM parameters required.</p>\n<p><strong>Log Viewer</strong></p>\n<p>The Log Viewer Tab is the console where you can view all RadiantOne log files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"related-material\">Related Material</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>RadiantOne System Administration Guide</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"identity-service-tools\">Identity Service Tools</h2>\n<p>RadiantOne includes a couple of tools designed to assist administrators with creating views containing unique lists of identities. The Data Analysis tool helps discover data quality issues and identify ideal attributes to base correlation rules on. The Global Identity Builder tool guides administrators through the identity integration and correlation process. For more information on the tools, please see the sections below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note]\r\nFor step-by-step instructions on using the tools, please see the Global Identity Builder Guide and RadiantOne Data Analysis Guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"global-identity-builder\">Global Identity Builder</h3>\n<p>The Global Identity Builder is used to build an integrated list of identities from multiple heterogeneous data sources. This process establishes a common index (union) and reference list for all identities. The result of this process is a virtual view containing a unique list of identities from multiple data sources which are extended with all relevant attributes required to comprise a global profile, with information remapped into whatever format the client application expects.</p>\n<p>The Global Identity Builder should be used in situations where applications require a single source to locate all users required for authentication and/or need to access a complete user profile for attribute-based authorization. It should be used in cases where the data sources contain overlapping users whether there is a single existing common identifier. It can also be used in cases where there are no overlapping users but a complete aggregated flat list of users is required. At the end of the Global Identity Builder process, a persistent cache is configured and initialized for the identity data. Configure a cache refresh strategy from the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab > Cache node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"identity-data-analysis\">Identity Data Analysis</h3>\n<p>The RadiantOne Identity Data Analysis tool analyzes the quality of data in the backends, helping you determine which attributes would be the best candidates for correlation rules.</p>\n<p>The Identity Data Analysis tool generates a report for each of your data sources. These reports give you a glimpse of your existing data and provide insight on the quality of your data and what is available for you to use for correlation logic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]\r\nYou can also choose to mount virtual views from each of your data sources below a global root naming context in RadiantOne and point the Identity Data Analysis tool to this location to perform a single analysis/report from all of your sources at once. This helps you detect attribute uniqueness and statistics across heterogeneous data sources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"related-material-1\">Related Material</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>RadiantOne Global Identity Builder Guide</li>\n<li>RadiantOne Data Analysis Guide</li>\n</ul>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"getting-started-with-radiantone"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Getting Started with RadiantOne"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As discussed throughout this document, at the heart of most identity integration problems is the need for an identity service that can be accessed to search/retrieve a unique user profile that is used for authentication and authorization.
