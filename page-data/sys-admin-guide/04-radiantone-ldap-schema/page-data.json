Each is summarized below and further described in its own section after.\r\n\tAdding an LDIF file that contains the new object classes and attributes to the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>&#x3C;instance_name>\\conf directory. This file should be named ldapschema_&#x3C;2 digit number greater than the existing file names>.ldif. After restarting the RadiantOne service, the new schema information is loaded into the server.\r\n\tExtending the Schema with Objects and Attributes Contained in .orx files.\r\n\tCreating new object classes and attributes in the Main Control Panel.\r\nExtending RadiantOne Schema with Objects and Attributes from an LDIF File\r\nThe LDIF file should be properly named, formatted, and saved to the following location on the RadiantOne leader node:\r\n&#x3C;RLI_HOME>/&#x3C;instance_name>/conf\t(default instance_name is vds_server)\r\nView the contents of the existing schema files in this location to understand the format required for the LDIF file and make sure your LDIF file follows this format.\r\nThe name of the LDIF file should be ldapschema_&#x3C;any 2 digit number greater than the existing file names>.ldif.  For example, the following schema files already exist by default: ldapschema_00.ldif, ldapschema_01.ldif, and ldapschema_05.ldif, so a new schema file could be ldapschema_03.ldif (any unused 2 digit number could be used).\r\nIMPORTANT NOTES – If an object class or attribute is defined in multiple ldapschema files numbered between ldapschema_00.ldif and ldapschema_49.ldif, the ldapschema file with the largest number will override the definition in lower numbered files. For example, if an object class named domain is defined in both ldapschema_01.ldif and ldapschema_10.ldif, the definition from ldapschema_10.ldif is used.\r\nThe ldapschema_50.ldif is a special file generated from .orx schema definitions. If an object class or attribute is defined in multiple ldapschema files numbered between ldapschema_50.ldif and ldapschema_98.ldif, the ldapschema file with the largest number will override the definition in the lower numbered files but will not override any definition in files numbered between ldapschema_00.ldif through ldapschema_49.ldif. For example, ldapschema_90.ldif would override ldapschema_50.ldif, but would not override a definition in ldapschema_48.ldif.\r\nThe ldapschema_99.ldif overrides all previous definitions in ldapschema_00-98.ldif.\r\nAs long as RadiantOne and ZooKeeper are running on the leader node machine where you add the LDIF file, the schema file takes effect after the RadiantOne on all nodes are restarted.\r\nExtending the RadiantOne Schema with Objects and Attributes Contained in .orx Files\r\nThe metadata from any backend that is virtualized by RadiantOne is maintained in a file with a .orx extension. All .orx files are shown in the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Configuration section, when the ORX Schema node is selected.  If you extracted a new schema, and it does not appear in the list, click the Refresh List button. To add the object classes and attributes contained in a file to the RadiantOne LDAP schema, check the Publish in Server Schema option next to the proper .orx file.  After all schema files have been selected, click the Generate LDAP Schema button.</p>\n<p>Figure 4. 1: ORX Files Available for Extending RadiantOne LDAP Schema\r\nThe object classes and attributes contained in the select files are added to the RadiantOne LDAP schema and can be viewed from the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Configuration section, LDAP Schema node.\r\nNote – if you have already added object classes and attributes from some .orx files, then they automatically have a check mark in the Publish in Server Schema column.  If you want them removed from the RadiantOne LDAP schema, uncheck them before clicking the Generate LDAP Schema button.\r\nExtending the RadiantOne Schema with New Objects and Attributes from the Main Control Panel\r\nObject classes and attributes can be manually defined from the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Configuration section -> LDAP Schema.</p>\n<p>Figure 4. 2: Manually Defining New Object Classes and Attributes\r\nCreate New Object Class</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Configuration section -> LDAP Schema node.</li>\n<li>On the right side, a list of object classes that currently comprise the RadiantOne LDAP schema is displayed.</li>\n<li>Click on the Add button at the bottom.</li>\n<li>Enter a name for the object class, parent (if it inherits from an existing object class), and OID (optional).
