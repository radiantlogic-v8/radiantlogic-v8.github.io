This process is called a “bind” operation and means, the client must tell the LDAP server who is going to be accessing the data so that the server can decide what the client is allowed to see and do (authorization). After the client successfully authenticates, RadiantOne checks whether the client is allowed to perform subsequent requests. This process is called authorization and is enforced via <a href=\"access-controls\">access controls</a>.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne supports three types of authentication: anonymous, simple and SASL.</p>\n<p><strong>Anonymous:</strong></p>\n<p>Clients that send an LDAP request without doing a \"bind\" are treated as anonymous. Clients who bind to RadiantOne without a password value are also considered anonymous.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple:</strong></p>\n<p>Simple authentication consists of sending the LDAP server the fully qualified DN of the client (user) and the client's clear-text password. To avoid exposing the password in clear over the network, you can use SSL (an encrypted channel). For details on configuring SSL, please see the <a href=\"security#ssl-settings\">SSL Settings</a> section.</p>\n<p><strong>SASL:</strong></p>\n<p>Clients that send an authentication request to RadiantOne using <!-- Kerberos (GSS-SPNEGO), (GSSAPI), --> MD5 (DIGEST-MD5) or Certificate (EXTERNAL) are leveraging one of the supported SASL mechanisms. The SASL EXTERNAL mechanism is supported by default, but you must configure the <a href=\"security#client-certificate-dn-mapping\">Client Certificate to DN Mapping</a> so the RadiantOne service knows how to identify the user in the certificate to a user in the RadiantOne namespace.

For mutual authentication, where there is a reciprocal trust relationship between the client and the server, the client must generate a certificate containing his identity and private key in his keystore. The client must also make a version of the certificate containing his identity and public key, which RadiantOne must store in its truststore. In turn, the client needs to trust the server; this is accomplished by importing the server's CA certificate into the client truststore.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Certificate-based authentication (mutual authentication) requires the use of SSL or StartTLS for the communication between the client and RadiantOne.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The diagram below shows how certificates and the SSL protocol are used together for authentication.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 38.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/b966c/Image3.82.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/c1cfe/Image3.82.jpg 275w,\n/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/67061/Image3.82.jpg 550w,\n/static/a1280f0a57c2fce308fd8fb5ca988b81/b966c/Image3.82.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 3.82: Mutual Authentication</p>\n<p>There are three options for mutual authentication and this can be set from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL > Mutual Auth.

For example, a client can process an LDAP search operation on a normal connection and then, without closing the connection, request a secure layer over the same connection with StartTLS for the use of changing passwords or viewing encrypted attributes. After finishing the use of the secure channel, the client can switch back to the non-secure channel on the same connection. The flexibility offered by the Start TLS extension allows for the secure LDAPS channel to be turned on and off on demand.\r\n\r\nTo enable Start TLS for clients to access RadiantOne:\r\n\r\n1.

The CRL has a limited validity period, and updated versions of the CRL are published by the CA when the previous CRL’s validity period expires.</p>\n<p>RadiantOne supports CRL checking and relies on the underlying Java security libraries (JSSE) to handle this logic during the SSL/TLS handshake process before the LDAP bind is received by the server. Both CRLDP and OCSP are supported. For CRLDP (CRL Distribution Point), there are URIs specified by the certificate's \"CRL Distribution Points\", by which the servers hosting CRL can be reached. For OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol), the URIs are specified in the certificate in the extended attribute “authorityInfoAccess”, by which the servers enforcing CRL checking can be reached. More details about OCSP can be found in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2560\">RFC 2560</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"enable-crl\">Enable CRL</h4>\n<p>If clients are connecting to RadiantOne with certificates (establishing mutual authentication) and the client certificate should be validated to ensure it has not been revoked prior to accepting it, the Enable CRL parameter needs checked. From the Main Control Panel go to the Settings tab > Security > SSL. Then, on the right side, check the Enable CRL option.</p>\n<h4 id=\"crl-methods\">CRL Methods</h4>\n<p>There are three different supported CRL checking methods; dynamic, static and failover. These methods are described below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The tradeoff between a static CRL file and a dynamic CRL checking would be that a dynamic CRL would be more robust and correct but the size of the CRL file may impact the performance of the revocation checking logic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic\">Dynamic</h3>\n<p>CRLDP and OCSP are used to determine certificate validity and revocation status. OCSP is checked first. If OCSP returns the certificate's status as unknown, then the CRLDP is used.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failover\">Failover</h3>\n<p>CRLDP and OCSP are used to determine certificate validity and revocation status (OCSP is checked first). If the checking fails to get the CRL from CRLDP and using OCSP, then it attempts to check the certificate’s status against the static CRL file(s). The CRL file must be uploaded to the RadiantOne service using Main Control Panel > Settings > Configuration > File Manager. This can be a zip file containing multiple CRL files if needed. The CRL file(s) are loaded only once when the RadiantOne service starts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"static\">Static</h3>\n<p>The certificate is validated against a preloaded local CRL file (this can be many files zipped together or could be a file system directory where all CRL files are located). The certificate authority’s CRL file must be uploaded to the RadiantOne service using Main Control Panel > Settings > Configuration > File Manager. This can be a zip file containing multiple CRL files if needed. The CRL file(s) are loaded only once when the RadiantOne service starts.</p>\n<p>To select the CRL method, from the Main Control Panel got to the Settings tab > Security > SSL.

Client certificates can be validated against this list.</p>\n<p>The Server Certificate Revocation List File parameter is configurable from the <a href=\"accessing-the-server-control-panel#accessing-the-server-control-panel\">Server Control Panel</a> > Settings tab. If you are deployed in a cluster, each node must have the CRL file on their host machine and the location can vary. Therefore, you must go into the Server Control Panel associated with each node and set the location of the CRL file.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inter-nodes-communication\">Inter Nodes Communication</h3>\n<p>Within a cluster, nodes must be able to communicate with each other. This is required for block replication (replicating data across RadiantOne Universal Directory stores) which uses the Admin HTTP Service <a href=\"settings-tab#admin-http-service\">HTTP/HTTPS</a> and redirecting write operations to the leader node which uses <a href=\"settings-tab#ldap-port\">LDAP/LDAPS</a>. If the communication across the cluster nodes should use SSL, choose the Always use SSL option. If your cluster nodes are running in a secured environment (and in general they should be), you can choose to never use SSL. Forcing the use of SSL will slow down the communication speed between nodes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 382px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 33.81818181818182%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Inter Nodes Communication\"\n        title=\"Inter Nodes Communication\"\n        src=\"/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/dc918/Image3.86.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/c1cfe/Image3.86.jpg 275w,\n/static/070619e2da77a05d5d79438088db24e3/dc918/Image3.86.jpg 382w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 5: Inter Nodes Communication</p>\n<p>--></p>\n<h2 id=\"authentication-methods\">Authentication Methods</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] This section is accessible only in <a href=\"introduction#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--\r\n### Kerberos\r\n\r\nRadiantOne supports Kerberos v5, and can act as both a [Kerberos client](server-backend#kerberos), and a Kerberized service. As a Kerberos client, RadiantOne can request tickets from a KDC to use to connect to kerberized services. As a Kerberized service, RadiantOne can accept tickets from clients as a form of authentication. These configurations have been certified with Windows 2000, 2003 and 2008 in addition to MIT Kerberos on Linux CENTOS. This section describes RadiantOne support as a Kerberized server. For details on RadiantOne support as a Kerberos client, please see the section on defining [LDAP data sources](server-backend#ldap-data-sources). The following diagram provides the high-level architecture and process flow for RadiantOne acting as a Kerberized service.\r\n\r\n![RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service](Media/Image3.87.jpg)\r\n \r\nFigure 6: RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service\r\n\r\nKerberos can be used for authentication to RadiantOne (acting as a Kerberized Service) as long as the client resides within the same domain or trusted domain forest as the RadiantOne service (and the RadiantOne machine must be in the same Kerberos realm/domain, or at least within the same forest as Active Directory). For authentication amongst un-trusted/different domains, the NTLM protocol is triggered instead. For details on configuring cross-domain authentication for RadiantOne, please see the section on [NTLM](security#ntlm). To continue with configuring Kerberos for access to RadiantOne in Microsoft domains, follow the steps below. For details on MIT Kerberos support, see [Support for MIT Kerberos](security#support-for-mit-kerberos).\r\n\r\n>[!note] All machines (client, domain controller…etc.) must be in sync in terms of clock (time/date settings). Also, if you have deployed RadiantOne in a cluster, the service account created in the KDC can use the server name of the load balancer that is configured in front of the RadiantOne cluster nodes.\r\n\r\n>**To use a generic or common account for multiple RadiantOne cluster nodes, you need to set the SPN on the account matching the FQDN of the host that requests the kerberos ticket. There is no need to create individual accounts for each RadiantOne node/host. Refer to the account using the UPN in the RadiantOne configuration.**\r\n\r\n>**The account can have multiple SPNs. An example is shown below.**\r\n\r\n>**sAMAccountName: svc-vdsadmin\r\nUPN: ldap/vds.example.net@example.net**\r\n\r\n>**SPN: ldap/host1.example.net\r\n        <br> ldap/vds.example.net\r\n        <br> ldap/host2.example.net\r\n        <br> ldap/host3.example.net**\r\n\r\n#### Configuring RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service\r\n\r\n>[!warning] RadiantOne MUST be running on port 389. The default port for RadiantOne is 2389. To change the port, you must stop the RadiantOne service, and then edit the port from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Administration section. After changing the port and saving your changes, restart the RadiantOne service. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, all the service on all nodes.\r\n\r\n1. Create a Kerberos identification for the RadiantOne service by creating a user account in the Active Directory domain controller (KDC) for the host computer on which RadiantOne runs. When creating the account, you can use the name of the computer. For example, if the host is named AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com, create a user in Active Directory with a user logon name of AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com.\r\n\r\n>[!note] If you have deployed RadiantOne in a cluster behind a load balancer (the clients access the load balancer), the KDC service account in Active Directory should use the server name of the load balancer. The UPN of the account should represent the load balancer machine and the SPN attribute should list the FQDN of each RadiantOne node in the cluster (as separate values of the SPN attribute). There is no need to create individual accounts for each RadiantOne host because the KDC account can have multiple SPNs. Each SPN will be associated with a RadiantOne node (and local traffic manager(s) if multiple layers of traffic managers are used). An example of a KDC account is described below.\r\n>sAMAccountName: svc-vdsadmin\r\n\r\n>UPN: ldap/vds.example.net@example.net\r\n\r\n>SPN: ldap/vds.example.net@example.net\r\n          <br>ldap/host1.example.net\r\n          <br>ldap/vds.example.net\r\n          <br>ldap/host2.example.net\r\n          <br>ldap/host3.example.net\r\n\r\n!Sample Active Directory Account for RadiantOne on the KDC](Media/Image3.88.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Sample Active Directory Account for RadiantOne on the KDC\r\n\r\n2. Create a User Mapping and Keytab file using KTPASS. \r\n\r\nIf you do not have the ktpass utility (part of the Windows Resource Kit Tools), you can download it from Microsoft’s website.\r\n\r\n        Below is a sample command to be run on the KDC machine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nktpass –princ ldap/AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com@CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM -pass password -mapuser “vds server” -out c:\\temp\\amazona-eq3pkp4.LDAP.keytab \r\n\r\n------result of executing the command------\r\nTargeting domain controller: AMAZONA-CMF8EDC.cloudcfs.radiant.com\r\nSuccessfully mapped AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com to AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.\r\nPassword successfully set!\r\nWARNING: pType and account type do not match.

Click **Save**.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe userPrincipalName and password associated with the service account created in Active Directory (KDC) in the [first step](#configuring-radiantone-as-a-kerberized-service) can be entered in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication section. RadiantOne uses this information to authenticate to the KDC when it starts if there is no keytab file present. If there is a keytab file present (and RadiantOne is configured to use it), and the keytab file contains the “principal” keyword with a value of the user principal name for the RadiantOne service account in the KDC, it is used to get the secret key/password to use for authenticating to the KDC instead of the settings configured in the Control Panel. If the keytab file does not contain the “principal” defined in it, you must set the user principal name in the Kerberos Authentication section, but you do not need to configure the password.\r\n\r\n5. Copy the keytab file created when running the ktpass utility to the RadiantOne machine (anywhere on the machine is fine) and configure the needed parameters described below. This step is optional. If there is no keytab file present, RadiantOne uses the service principal and password that are defined on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication to authenticate to the KDC. \r\n\r\nIf you choose to copy the keytab file to the RadiantOne machine, edit the <RLI_HOME>/<instance_name>/conf/krb5/vds_krb5login.conf file. To enable RadiantOne to participate in SSO with clients via Kerberos tokens, a JAAS login file is needed to tell where and how the RadiantOne service is authenticated. The JAAS login file (vds_ krb5login.conf) is provided with RadiantOne. The default content of this file is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvds_server {\r\ncom.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\r\nstoreKey=true;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf RadiantOne should use the keytab file, add the following parameters to the vds_krb5login.conf file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuseKeyTab=true\r\nkeyTab= \"c:/radiantone/amazona-eq3pkp4.LDAP.keytab”\r\n```\r\n\r\n**useKeyTab** – set this to true if you want the server to get the principal’s key from the keytab. The default value (if this parameter is not set in the file) is False. As mentioned above, if there is no keytab specified, RadiantOne uses the service name and password defined on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication section on the right side, to authenticate to the KDC when the RadiantOne service first starts.\r\n\r\n**principal** – set this to the user principal name of the account in the KDC associated with the RadiantOne service. If this property is not defined in the keytab file, it must be set in the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Security section -> Authentication Methods sub-section -> Kerberos Authentication section.\r\n\r\n**keyTab** – set this to the full path and file name of the keytab to get the principal’s secret key. Surround the value with double quotes and the word keyTab is case-sensitive (it should appear in the vds_krb5login.conf file in this exact case).\r\n\r\nFor information on other optional configuration parameters, please refer to the Krb5LoginModule class in the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) documentation.\r\n\r\n6. Edit the RadiantOne Kerberos configuration file to include the realm and KDC. The Kerberos configuration file is named vds_server_krb5.conf and is in <RLI_HOME>/vds_server/conf/krb5.\r\n\r\nEdit this file and set the appropriate values in the [libdefaults] and [realms] sections. Below is an example that matches the use case we have been using in this section.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[libdefaults]\r\ndefault_realm = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM\r\n[realms]\r\nCLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM = {\r\nkdc = 10.11.12.205:88\r\ndefault_domain = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.\tVerify the RadiantOne rootdse responds with the appropriate Supported SASL Mechanisms by using a client (e.g. LDAP Browser) to query RadiantOne with a “blank/empty” base DN. The following should be returned.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsupportedSASLMechanisms: GSSAPI\r\nsupportedSASLMechanisms: GSS-SPNEGO\r\n```\r\n\r\n8. Configure Client Principal Name Mapping. This step is optional and can be used to define a mapping between the user who authenticates with a Kerberos ticket and a user DN in the virtual namespace. The DN is required for the RadiantOne service to enforce access permissions (authorization). If no client principal name mappings are configured, RadiantOne creates an account in a local Universal Directory store that is linked to the person who authenticated using a Kerberos ticket.\r\n\r\nThere are three different ways to determine the DN from the user ID in the Kerberos ticket received in the LDAP bind (using regular expression syntax). Each is described below.\r\n\r\n-\tSetting a specific User ID to DN. In this example, if lcallahan were received in the authentication request, RadiantOne would base the authorization on the DN: cn=laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\r\n\r\n```\r\nlcallahan (the user ID) 🡪 (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\r\n```\r\n\r\n-\tSpecify a DN Suffix, replacing the $1 value with the User ID.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(.+) -> uid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n(.+) represents the value coming in to RadiantOne from the Kerberos ticket. If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan, then the DN used for authorization is: uid=lcallahan,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com.\r\n```\r\n\r\n-\tSpecify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the User ID received in the bind request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(.+) -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan from the Kerberos ticket, it would issue a search like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the virtual namespace and to base authorization decisions on.\r\n\r\nFor the second and third options described above, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the examples). Let’s look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(.+)@(.+).(.+).com -> ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=$1)(dc=$3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf RadiantOne received a user ID like laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com, the search that would be issued would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details, please see [Processing Multiple Mapping Rules](interception#processing-multiple-mapping-rules).\r\n\r\nThe user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the RadiantOne namespace and to base authorization decisions on. For more information, please see [Authorization of Kerberos Users](security#authorization-of-kerberos-users).\r\n\r\nChanging any Kerberos-related parameters requires a restart of the RadiantOne service. Save your changes prior to restarting the service. \r\n\r\n#### Accessing RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service from a Kerberos Client\r\n\r\nThe Kerberos client (user or machine) must also have an account on the KDC machine.\r\n\r\n>[!warning] RadiantOne must be running on a different machine than the client that is connecting to it, otherwise the Microsoft libraries for LDAP use the local security and not a Kerberos ticket.

To manage the Kerberos database locally, launch\r\n\r\n```\r\nkadmin.local\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add the RadiantOne service to Kerberos database with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nadd_principal ldap/vds.novato.radiantlogic.com@EXAMPLE.COM\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Ensure FQDN of service can be resolved via DNS using ping or other methods.\r\n\r\n4. Ensure unlimited Java cipher suites are installed. This is to be compatible with certain clients using stronger cyphers. Note that Kerberos can be enabled in RadiantOne without installing the extra ciphers, but most clients using kerberos require these ciphers that RadiantOne does not bundle out of the box. For details on installing unlimited cipher suites, see the RadiantOne Hardening Guide.\r\n\r\n5. From the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods enable Kerberos Authentication and enter the user principal name and service password associated with the RadiantOne service account that was created in the KDC.\r\n\r\n6. Click **CHANGE** next to Client Principal Name Mapping and define the mapping to be used for authorization.\r\n\r\n7. Restart the RadiantOne service.\r\n\r\n![Enabling RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service](Media/Image3.98.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 16: Enabling RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service\r\n\r\n#### Authorization of Kerberos Users\r\n\r\nAfter a client successfully authenticates with a Kerberos ticket, RadiantOne tries to link the user to a DN based on any Client Principal Name Mappings that you have set up. If no Client Principal Name Mappings are defined or if no mapping results are found for a particular user, RadiantOne translates the user principal name and realm into a DN and stores that user in the local LDAP store below a suffix of ou=krbusers,cn=config. The user DN consists of the principal name and the realm (from which they came from). An example would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuid=lcallahan,cn=NOVATO.RADIANTLOGIC.COM,ou=krbusers,cn=config\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, all users who authenticate from the NOVATO.RADIANTLOGIC.COM realm are located here. Each realm has its own location in the local LDAP store. Below is an example from a different realm:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuid=sbuchanan,cn=NA.RADIANTLOGIC.COM,ou=krbusers,cn=config\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the user is stored locally (or linked to an existing DN), they can be added to groups and included in access control lists. This allows users who authenticate using Kerberos access to protected information in the RadiantOne namespace. See below for the location in the directory tree for the authenticated users (This location is for users that could not be linked using Client Principal Name Mappings).\r\n\r\n![An image showing ](Media/Image3.99.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 17: Location of Users who Successfully Authenticate using Kerberos\r\n\r\n### NTLM\r\n\r\nSASL binding via GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO will attempt to use Kerberos by default. You have the option to use NTLM in conjunction with Kerberos, or not at all (based on your company security policy). If used in conjunction with Kerberos, it applies as a backup protocol to be used if there is a problem with Kerberos authentication. If enabled, the NTLM protocol is used if one of the systems involved in authentication cannot use Kerberos authentication, is configured improperly, or if the client application does not provide sufficient information to use Kerberos. If NTLM is not enabled, and there is a problem with the Kerberos authentication, the bind (using GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO) to RadiantOne fails. Also, By using NTLM, RadiantOne is able to support cross-domain authentication. This means, that a user that is not logged into the same domain that RadiantOne is a member of (or a domain that is trusted by the RadiantOne domain) can still access RadiantOne and benefit from NTLM for authentication. RadiantOne supports NTLM v2.\r\n\r\nLike all challenge-response protocols, the password is not sent over the protocol but the challenge instead. Since NTLM relies on the domain controller to authenticate its users, RadiantOne needs to know on which domain controller the challenge is generated before sending the challenge back to the user. This information can typically be retrieved from user’s request. If the domain information is not passed, RadiantOne takes the default one to generate the challenge. The first domain listed in the NT Domain parameter is the default one. The diagram below depicts the architecture and process flows.\r\n\r\n![RadiantOne Support for NTLM Authentication](Media/Image3.100.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 18: RadiantOne Support for NTLM Authentication\r\n\r\n<!-- In the figure above, since the client is accessing RadiantOne from domain B and VDS has been “kerberized” in domain A (and domain A and B do not trust each other), Kerberos cannot be used for authentication. However, NTLM can. The NTLM authentication flow is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Client binds to RadiantOne - The client sends an LDAP bind request to RadiantOne via GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO along with an NTLM Type 1 Message {e.g. NT_Domain=‘DOMAINB' Workstation='W-RLI06-MACHINE1' }\r\n\r\n2. RadiantOne requests an NTLM challenge message. RadiantOne requests an NTLM challenge from the required domain controller. RadiantOne knows which domain controller to send the request to because of the NT_Domain property that came in the bind request. If the NT_Domain property is not passed, RadiantOne uses the first one configured in the NT Domain property list.\r\n\r\n3. Domain controller responds with a challenge. The domain controller generates a challenge, and sends it to RadiantOne.\r\n\r\n4. RadiantOne sends the challenge message to client. The challenge message includes an LDAP bind response code 14 (SASL_BIND_IN_PROGRESS). This indicates the server requires the client to send a new bind request, with the same SASL mechanism, to continue the authentication process. \r\n\r\n5. Client sends response message. The client then issues a new bind request via GSS-SPNEGO along with an NTLM Type 3 Message {e.g. Username='test5' NT_Domain=‘DOMAINB' }.\r\n\r\n6. RadiantOne requests domain controller validate the challenge and response. RadiantOne sends the username, the original challenge, and the response from the client computer to the domain controller. \r\n\r\n7. Domain controller compares challenge and response to authenticate user. The domain controller obtains the password hash for the user, and then uses this hash to encrypt the original challenge. Next, the domain controller compares the encrypted challenge with the response from the client computer. If they match, the domain controller sends RadiantOne confirmation that the user is authenticated. Otherwise, user is not authenticated.\r\n\r\n8. RadiantOne sends bind response to the client. Assuming valid credentials, RadiantOne grants the client access.\r\n\r\nTo enable NTLM:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section.\r\n\r\n2. Check the NTLM Authentication option.\r\n\r\n3. Each domain that should be supported needs to be configured in this list. The default domain is empty by default and must be configured. Therefore, select the default domain in the list and click **EDIT**.\r\n\r\n4. Enter the NT Domain, client principal suffix, Domain Controller IP Address, Domain Controller Host BIOS Name, RadiantOne Computer Account (in the domain), RadiantOne Computer Account Password, IP Range, and configure a client principal name mapping if applicable. An example of NTLM settings is shown below.\r\n\r\n![NTLM Domain Controller Configuration](Media/Image3.101.jpg)\r\n\r\nFigure 19: NTLM Domain Controller Configuration\r\n\r\nMore details about the NT Domain Controller settings can be found below. After you have configured the default domain, click **ADD** to add any additional domains that are required.\r\n\r\n>[!note] Changing any of these parameters requires a restart of the RadiantOne service. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.\r\n\r\n**NT Domain**\r\n\r\nA unique domain name that a client may belong to (connecting to RadiantOne from). If the client is not connecting to RadiantOne from the same domain (or a trusted domain), then their domain must be configured otherwise they cannot connect to RadiantOne.\r\n\r\n**Client Principal Suffix**\r\n\r\nThe “Kerberos style” realm that corresponds to the above NT domain. \r\n\r\n**DC IP Address**\r\n\r\nEnter the IP address of the domain controller you configured in the NT Domain property.\r\n\r\n**DC Host BIOS Name**\r\n\r\nEnter the host name (NETBIOS name) of the machine hosting the NT Domain.\r\n\r\n**Computer Account**\r\n\r\nRadiantOne must have a service account (defined as a computer account) in the NT Domain. If the RadiantOne host machine joined an Active Directory (AD) domain, the domain controller should have already generated a Computer account for your host. It is under the node \"CN=Computer, DC=`<domain>`\" in AD. However, RadiantOne does not require a physical Computer account to run NTLMv2. It can be a service account but it must be defined under the \"CN=Computers\" container. To create a service/computer account in your NT Domain, from the Active Directory Users and Computers interface, right-click on the \"CN=Computers\" node. Choose 'New' and then click on 'Computer'. Follow the wizard to create a service computer account. \r\n\r\nThe Computer Account value you enter in the Main Control Panel must be in format of: `<computer_name>$@<domain>`\r\ne.g. NTLMv2$@testad.com \r\n\r\n**Computer Account Password**\r\n\r\nThe password for the RadiantOne service/computer account in the NT Domain should be entered here. Assigning or resetting the password for a computer account can be done with ADSIEdit. From the Active Directory domain controller machine, launch ADSIEdit (run adsiedit.msc). Browse to the Computer account, right click on it, and choose \"Reset Password\". The password can be entered here. Also update this password for the computer account password property in the Main Control Panel.\r\n\r\n**IP Range**\r\n\r\nThis list defines the IP Addresses for the clients that are authenticated to this configured domain controller. IP Range is required for all configured domains except the default one.\r\n\r\nIf the client can send the Domain information to RadiantOne in the Type 1 message, RadiantOne would be able to choose which domain controller to generate the corresponding challenge, which is embedded in the Type 2 message sent back to client. If the client is not able to indicate the Domain in the Type 1 message, RadiantOne references the IP ranges configured and determine the relevant domain. If based on the configured IP ranges (across all configured domains), RadiantOne cannot determine which domain to use, it uses the default one.\r\n\r\n**Client Principal Name Mapping**\r\n\r\nAfter authentication via NTLM, authorization (access permissions) must be determined. Client Principal Name Mapping can be used to set up a mapping between the user who authenticates using NTLM and a user DN. The DN is required to set access permissions and for RadiantOne to enforce authorization. If no client principal name mappings are configured (or the ones configured fail to link the username to a valid DN in the virtual tree), then RadiantOne allows [anonymous access](access-control#allow-anonymous-access) (you must make sure anonymous access is allowed). To configure the mapping, click **Change** next to the Client Principal Name Mapping parameter.\r\n\r\nThere are three different ways to determine the DN from the user ID received in the LDAP bind (using regular expression syntax). Each is described below.\r\n\r\n-\tSetting a specific User ID to DN. In this example, if lcallahan were received in the authentication request, RadiantOne would base the authorization on the DN: cn=laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\r\n\r\n```\r\nlcallahan (the user ID) -> (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Specify a DN Suffix, replacing the $1 value with the User ID.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(.+) -> uid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com\r\n\r\n(.+) represents the value coming into RadiantOne from the bind operation. If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan, then the DN it bases authorization on is: uid=lcallahan,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com.\r\n```\r\n\r\n-\tSpecify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the User ID received in the bind request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(.+) -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan from the bind request, it would issue a search like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the RadiantOne namespace and to base authorization decisions on.\r\n\r\nFor options 2 and 3 described above, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the examples). Let’s take a look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(.+)@(.+).(.+).com -> ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=$1)(dc=$3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf RadiantOne received a user ID like laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com, the search that would be issued would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identity the user entry in the virtual namespace and to base authorization decisions on.\r\n\r\nFor more details, please see [Processing Multiple Mapping Rules](interception#processing-multiple-mapping-rules).\r\n\r\nChanging any NTLM-related parameters requires a restart of RadiantOne. Click **Save** prior to restarting. If deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.\r\n\r\n-->\n<h3 id=\"md5\">MD5</h3>\n<p>If desired, an LDAP client can send RadiantOne a hashed password using Digest MD5 for authentication. RadiantOne must have access to the password in clear. When the password is received, RadiantOne uses the Digest MD5 hashing algorithm to encrypt it and compare to the value received from the client. If the compare succeeds, the bind was successful. Otherwise, the bind fails.</p>\n<p>To enable MD5 authentication, check the MD5 Authentication box from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section.</p>\n<p>Changing any MD5-related settings requires a restart of the RadiantOne service after saving the new settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Server Fully Qualified Name</strong></p>\n<p>Enter the Server fully qualified name for the machine running RadiantOne (&#x3C;machine_name>.&#x3C;domain_name>).</p>\n<p><strong>Client User Name Mapping</strong></p>\n<p>After authentication via MD5, authorization (access permissions) must be determined.

As a Kerberos client, RadiantOne can request tickets from a KDC to use to connect to kerberized services. As a Kerberized service, RadiantOne can accept tickets from clients as a form of authentication. These configurations have been certified with Windows 2000, 2003 and 2008 in addition to MIT Kerberos on Linux CENTOS. This section describes RadiantOne support as a Kerberized server. For details on RadiantOne support as a Kerberos client, please see the section on defining [LDAP data sources](server-backend#ldap-data-sources). The following diagram provides the high-level architecture and process flow for RadiantOne acting as a Kerberized service.\n\n![RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service](Media/Image3.87.jpg)\n \nFigure 6: RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service\n\nKerberos can be used for authentication to RadiantOne (acting as a Kerberized Service) as long as the client resides within the same domain or trusted domain forest as the RadiantOne service (and the RadiantOne machine must be in the same Kerberos realm/domain, or at least within the same forest as Active Directory). For authentication amongst un-trusted/different domains, the NTLM protocol is triggered instead. For details on configuring cross-domain authentication for RadiantOne, please see the section on [NTLM](security#ntlm). To continue with configuring Kerberos for access to RadiantOne in Microsoft domains, follow the steps below. For details on MIT Kerberos support, see [Support for MIT Kerberos](security#support-for-mit-kerberos).\n\n>[!note] All machines (client, domain controller…etc.) must be in sync in terms of clock (time/date settings). Also, if you have deployed RadiantOne in a cluster, the service account created in the KDC can use the server name of the load balancer that is configured in front of the RadiantOne cluster nodes.\n\n>**To use a generic or common account for multiple RadiantOne cluster nodes, you need to set the SPN on the account matching the FQDN of the host that requests the kerberos ticket. There is no need to create individual accounts for each RadiantOne node/host. Refer to the account using the UPN in the RadiantOne configuration.**\n\n>**The account can have multiple SPNs. An example is shown below.**\n\n>**sAMAccountName: svc-vdsadmin\nUPN: ldap/vds.example.net@example.net**\n\n>**SPN: ldap/host1.example.net\n        <br> ldap/vds.example.net\n        <br> ldap/host2.example.net\n        <br> ldap/host3.example.net**\n\n#### Configuring RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service\n\n>[!warning] RadiantOne MUST be running on port 389. The default port for RadiantOne is 2389. To change the port, you must stop the RadiantOne service, and then edit the port from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Administration section. After changing the port and saving your changes, restart the RadiantOne service. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, all the service on all nodes.\n\n1. Create a Kerberos identification for the RadiantOne service by creating a user account in the Active Directory domain controller (KDC) for the host computer on which RadiantOne runs. When creating the account, you can use the name of the computer. For example, if the host is named AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com, create a user in Active Directory with a user logon name of AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com.\n\n>[!note] If you have deployed RadiantOne in a cluster behind a load balancer (the clients access the load balancer), the KDC service account in Active Directory should use the server name of the load balancer. The UPN of the account should represent the load balancer machine and the SPN attribute should list the FQDN of each RadiantOne node in the cluster (as separate values of the SPN attribute). There is no need to create individual accounts for each RadiantOne host because the KDC account can have multiple SPNs. Each SPN will be associated with a RadiantOne node (and local traffic manager(s) if multiple layers of traffic managers are used). An example of a KDC account is described below.\n>sAMAccountName: svc-vdsadmin\n\n>UPN: ldap/vds.example.net@example.net\n\n>SPN: ldap/vds.example.net@example.net\n          <br>ldap/host1.example.net\n          <br>ldap/vds.example.net\n          <br>ldap/host2.example.net\n          <br>ldap/host3.example.net\n\n!Sample Active Directory Account for RadiantOne on the KDC](Media/Image3.88.jpg)\n\nFigure 7: Sample Active Directory Account for RadiantOne on the KDC\n\n2. Create a User Mapping and Keytab file using KTPASS. \n\nIf you do not have the ktpass utility (part of the Windows Resource Kit Tools), you can download it from Microsoft’s website.\n\n        Below is a sample command to be run on the KDC machine:\n\n```\nktpass –princ ldap/AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com@CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM -pass password -mapuser “vds server” -out c:\\temp\\amazona-eq3pkp4.LDAP.keytab \n\n------result of executing the command------\nTargeting domain controller: AMAZONA-CMF8EDC.cloudcfs.radiant.com\nSuccessfully mapped AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.cloudcfs.radiant.com to AMAZONA-EQ3PKP4.\nPassword successfully set!\nWARNING: pType and account type do not match. This might cause problems.\nKey created.\nOutput keytab to c:\\temp\\amazona-eq3pkp4.LDAP.keytab:\nKeytab version: 0x502\nkeysize 97 ldap/amazona-eq3pkp4.radiant.com@CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM ptype 0 (KRB5_NT_UNKNOWN) vno 3 etype 0x17 (RC4-HMAC) keylength 16 (0xf70be0d13c22ee9e2bc249af6874019e)\n```\n\n-\tAmazona-eq3pkp4.cloudcfs.radiant.com is the fully qualified domain name for the machine running RadiantOne.\n-\tCLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM is the realm and must be in upper case in the ktpass command.\n-\tpassword is the password for the user account created in Step 1. \n-\tThe keytab file will be in c:/temp and be named amazon-eq3pkp4.LDAP.keytab.\n\nAfter executing the ktpass command, if you go into the Active Directory account created in [Step 1](#configuring-radiantone-as-a-kerberized-service), you will see that the user login name value has been changed to ldap/amazona-eq3pkp4.cloudcfs.radiant.com.\n\n![Example User Account on the KDC after using the ktpass Utility](Media/Image3.89.jpg)\n\nFigure 8: Example User Account on the KDC after using the ktpass Utility\n\n3.\tGo to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section and check the box to enable Kerberos Authentication. Click **Save**.\n\n4.\tThe userPrincipalName and password associated with the service account created in Active Directory (KDC) in the [first step](#configuring-radiantone-as-a-kerberized-service) can be entered in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication section. RadiantOne uses this information to authenticate to the KDC when it starts if there is no keytab file present. If there is a keytab file present (and RadiantOne is configured to use it), and the keytab file contains the “principal” keyword with a value of the user principal name for the RadiantOne service account in the KDC, it is used to get the secret key/password to use for authenticating to the KDC instead of the settings configured in the Control Panel. If the keytab file does not contain the “principal” defined in it, you must set the user principal name in the Kerberos Authentication section, but you do not need to configure the password.\n\n5. Copy the keytab file created when running the ktpass utility to the RadiantOne machine (anywhere on the machine is fine) and configure the needed parameters described below. This step is optional. If there is no keytab file present, RadiantOne uses the service principal and password that are defined on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication to authenticate to the KDC. \n\nIf you choose to copy the keytab file to the RadiantOne machine, edit the <RLI_HOME>/<instance_name>/conf/krb5/vds_krb5login.conf file. To enable RadiantOne to participate in SSO with clients via Kerberos tokens, a JAAS login file is needed to tell where and how the RadiantOne service is authenticated. The JAAS login file (vds_ krb5login.conf) is provided with RadiantOne. The default content of this file is as follows:\n\n```\nvds_server {\ncom.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\nstoreKey=true;\n};\n```\n\nIf RadiantOne should use the keytab file, add the following parameters to the vds_krb5login.conf file:\n\n```\nuseKeyTab=true\nkeyTab= \"c:/radiantone/amazona-eq3pkp4.LDAP.keytab”\n```\n\n**useKeyTab** – set this to true if you want the server to get the principal’s key from the keytab. The default value (if this parameter is not set in the file) is False. As mentioned above, if there is no keytab specified, RadiantOne uses the service name and password defined on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security Section > Authentication Methods sub-section > Kerberos Authentication section on the right side, to authenticate to the KDC when the RadiantOne service first starts.\n\n**principal** – set this to the user principal name of the account in the KDC associated with the RadiantOne service. If this property is not defined in the keytab file, it must be set in the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Security section -> Authentication Methods sub-section -> Kerberos Authentication section.\n\n**keyTab** – set this to the full path and file name of the keytab to get the principal’s secret key. Surround the value with double quotes and the word keyTab is case-sensitive (it should appear in the vds_krb5login.conf file in this exact case).\n\nFor information on other optional configuration parameters, please refer to the Krb5LoginModule class in the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) documentation.\n\n6. Edit the RadiantOne Kerberos configuration file to include the realm and KDC. The Kerberos configuration file is named vds_server_krb5.conf and is in <RLI_HOME>/vds_server/conf/krb5.\n\nEdit this file and set the appropriate values in the [libdefaults] and [realms] sections. Below is an example that matches the use case we have been using in this section.\n\n```\n[libdefaults]\ndefault_realm = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM\n[realms]\nCLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM = {\nkdc = 10.11.12.205:88\ndefault_domain = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM\n}\n```\n\n7.\tVerify the RadiantOne rootdse responds with the appropriate Supported SASL Mechanisms by using a client (e.g. LDAP Browser) to query RadiantOne with a “blank/empty” base DN. The following should be returned.\n\n```\nsupportedSASLMechanisms: GSSAPI\nsupportedSASLMechanisms: GSS-SPNEGO\n```\n\n8. Configure Client Principal Name Mapping. This step is optional and can be used to define a mapping between the user who authenticates with a Kerberos ticket and a user DN in the virtual namespace. The DN is required for the RadiantOne service to enforce access permissions (authorization). If no client principal name mappings are configured, RadiantOne creates an account in a local Universal Directory store that is linked to the person who authenticated using a Kerberos ticket.\n\nThere are three different ways to determine the DN from the user ID in the Kerberos ticket received in the LDAP bind (using regular expression syntax). Each is described below.\n\n-\tSetting a specific User ID to DN. In this example, if lcallahan were received in the authentication request, RadiantOne would base the authorization on the DN: cn=laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\n\n```\nlcallahan (the user ID) 🡪 (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\n```\n\n-\tSpecify a DN Suffix, replacing the $1 value with the User ID.\n\n```\n(.+) -> uid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com\n```\n\n```\n(.+) represents the value coming in to RadiantOne from the Kerberos ticket. If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan, then the DN used for authorization is: uid=lcallahan,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com.\n```\n\n-\tSpecify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the User ID received in the bind request.\n\n```\n(.+) -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)\n```\n\nIf RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan from the Kerberos ticket, it would issue a search like:\n\n```\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)\n```\n\nThe user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the virtual namespace and to base authorization decisions on.\n\nFor the second and third options described above, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the examples). Let’s look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:\n\n```\n(.+)@(.+).(.+).com -> ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=$1)(dc=$3))\n```\n\nIf RadiantOne received a user ID like laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com, the search that would be issued would look like:\n\n```\nou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))\n```\n\nFor more details, please see [Processing Multiple Mapping Rules](interception#processing-multiple-mapping-rules).\n\nThe user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the RadiantOne namespace and to base authorization decisions on. For more information, please see [Authorization of Kerberos Users](security#authorization-of-kerberos-users).\n\nChanging any Kerberos-related parameters requires a restart of the RadiantOne service. Save your changes prior to restarting the service. \n\n#### Accessing RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service from a Kerberos Client\n\nThe Kerberos client (user or machine) must also have an account on the KDC machine.\n\n>[!warning] RadiantOne must be running on a different machine than the client that is connecting to it, otherwise the Microsoft libraries for LDAP use the local security and not a Kerberos ticket. This is only relevant for LDAP clients that use the Microsoft libraries (LDP and Softerra LDAP Administrator v3.3 for example).\n\nThe following example configurations describe:\n\n-\tUsing JXplorer as the LDAP client connecting to RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.\n\n-\tUsing LDP as the LDAP client connecting to RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.\n\n-\tUsing Softerra LDAP Administrator v3.3 connecting to RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.\n\n**Example 1 – Using JXplorer Client**\n\nThe Kerberos client user account logs into their machine and they must first make sure that JXplorer is configured to use Kerberos.\n\nEdit the jxplorer.bat file (to pass a Java parameter specifying where to find the Kerberos configuration file) and then start JXplorer using this bat file. Below is an example of the file content. The Kerberos filename in this example is Kerberos.conf:\n\n```\n--------------------------------jxplorer.bat---------------------------------------------\nrem # Use this version if limited by 256 character max batch file length (earlier windows versions)\nrem # java -Djava.ext.dirs=jars;dsml/jars com.ca.directory.jxplorer.JXplorer\n\nrem # This version is slightly preferable, as it doesn't override the standard java extensions directory\nrem # (note that 'classes' is only used if you are compiling the code yourself; otherwise jars/jxplorer.jar is used.)\njava -Djava.security.krb5.conf=kerberos.conf -classpath .;jars/jxplorer.jar;jars/help.jar;jars/jhall.jar;jars/junit.jar;jars/ldapsec.jar;jars/log4j.jar;jars/dsml/activation.jar;jars/dsml/commons-logging.jar;jars/dsml/dom4j.jar;jars/dsml/dsmlv2.jar;jars/dsml/mail.jar;jars/dsml/saaf-api.jar;jars/dsml/saaj-ri.jar com.ca.directory.jxplorer.JXplorer\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nBelow is an example of the Kerberos configuration file that JXplorer references:\n\n```\n--------------------------------kerberos.conf-----------------------------------------------------\n[libdefaults]\n\tdefault_realm = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM\n\n[realms]\n\tCLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM = {\n\t\tkdc = 10.11.12.205:88\n\t\tdefault_domain = CLOUDCFS.RADIANT.COM\n\t}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nAfter you run JXplorer, click on connect and enter the parameters to connect to RadiantOne. In the Security section, choose the GSSAPI option.\n\n![JXplorer Authenticating to RadiantOne using Kerberos](Media/Image3.90.jpg)\n\nFigure 9: JXplorer Authenticating to RadiantOne using Kerberos\n\nAfter the Kerberos client user successfully authenticates via Kerberos, authorization will be determined based on the access rights configured in RadiantOne.

Create a new profile specifying the RadiantOne connection criteria. Be sure to use the fully qualified name for RadiantOne machine.\n\n![Sample Connection to RadiantOne from Softerra](Media/Image3.94.jpg)\n\nFigure 13: Sample Connection to RadiantOne from Softerra\n\n2. Click **Next**.\n\n3. You can choose the option currently logged on user (for Active Directory only) or select the GSS Negotiate mechanism and specify the username you want to use to connect and click Finish.

For more information, please see the section titled, [Authorization of Kerberos Users](security#authorization-of-kerberos-users).\n \n#### Support for MIT Kerberos\n\nThe following steps were certified on Linux CENTOS to configure RadiantOne as a Kerberized service.\n\n1. To manage the Kerberos database locally, launch\n\n```\nkadmin.local\n```\n\n2. Add the RadiantOne service to Kerberos database with the following:\n\n```\nadd_principal ldap/vds.novato.radiantlogic.com@EXAMPLE.COM\n```\n\n3. Ensure FQDN of service can be resolved via DNS using ping or other methods.\n\n4. Ensure unlimited Java cipher suites are installed. This is to be compatible with certain clients using stronger cyphers. Note that Kerberos can be enabled in RadiantOne without installing the extra ciphers, but most clients using kerberos require these ciphers that RadiantOne does not bundle out of the box. For details on installing unlimited cipher suites, see the RadiantOne Hardening Guide.\n\n5. From the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods enable Kerberos Authentication and enter the user principal name and service password associated with the RadiantOne service account that was created in the KDC.\n\n6. Click **CHANGE** next to Client Principal Name Mapping and define the mapping to be used for authorization.\n\n7. Restart the RadiantOne service.\n\n![Enabling RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service](Media/Image3.98.jpg)\n\nFigure 16: Enabling RadiantOne as a Kerberized Service\n\n#### Authorization of Kerberos Users\n\nAfter a client successfully authenticates with a Kerberos ticket, RadiantOne tries to link the user to a DN based on any Client Principal Name Mappings that you have set up. If no Client Principal Name Mappings are defined or if no mapping results are found for a particular user, RadiantOne translates the user principal name and realm into a DN and stores that user in the local LDAP store below a suffix of ou=krbusers,cn=config. The user DN consists of the principal name and the realm (from which they came from). An example would be:\n\n```\nuid=lcallahan,cn=NOVATO.RADIANTLOGIC.COM,ou=krbusers,cn=config\n```\n\nIn the example above, all users who authenticate from the NOVATO.RADIANTLOGIC.COM realm are located here. Each realm has its own location in the local LDAP store. Below is an example from a different realm:\n\n```\nuid=sbuchanan,cn=NA.RADIANTLOGIC.COM,ou=krbusers,cn=config\n```\n\nOnce the user is stored locally (or linked to an existing DN), they can be added to groups and included in access control lists. This allows users who authenticate using Kerberos access to protected information in the RadiantOne namespace. See below for the location in the directory tree for the authenticated users (This location is for users that could not be linked using Client Principal Name Mappings).\n\n![An image showing ](Media/Image3.99.jpg)\n\nFigure 17: Location of Users who Successfully Authenticate using Kerberos\n\n### NTLM\n\nSASL binding via GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO will attempt to use Kerberos by default. You have the option to use NTLM in conjunction with Kerberos, or not at all (based on your company security policy). If used in conjunction with Kerberos, it applies as a backup protocol to be used if there is a problem with Kerberos authentication. If enabled, the NTLM protocol is used if one of the systems involved in authentication cannot use Kerberos authentication, is configured improperly, or if the client application does not provide sufficient information to use Kerberos. If NTLM is not enabled, and there is a problem with the Kerberos authentication, the bind (using GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO) to RadiantOne fails. Also, By using NTLM, RadiantOne is able to support cross-domain authentication. This means, that a user that is not logged into the same domain that RadiantOne is a member of (or a domain that is trusted by the RadiantOne domain) can still access RadiantOne and benefit from NTLM for authentication. RadiantOne supports NTLM v2.\n\nLike all challenge-response protocols, the password is not sent over the protocol but the challenge instead. Since NTLM relies on the domain controller to authenticate its users, RadiantOne needs to know on which domain controller the challenge is generated before sending the challenge back to the user. This information can typically be retrieved from user’s request. If the domain information is not passed, RadiantOne takes the default one to generate the challenge. The first domain listed in the NT Domain parameter is the default one. The diagram below depicts the architecture and process flows.\n\n![RadiantOne Support for NTLM Authentication](Media/Image3.100.jpg)\n\nFigure 18: RadiantOne Support for NTLM Authentication\n\n<!-- In the figure above, since the client is accessing RadiantOne from domain B and VDS has been “kerberized” in domain A (and domain A and B do not trust each other), Kerberos cannot be used for authentication. However, NTLM can. The NTLM authentication flow is as follows:\n\n1. Client binds to RadiantOne - The client sends an LDAP bind request to RadiantOne via GSSAPI/GSS-SPNEGO along with an NTLM Type 1 Message {e.g. NT_Domain=‘DOMAINB' Workstation='W-RLI06-MACHINE1' }\n\n2. RadiantOne requests an NTLM challenge message. RadiantOne requests an NTLM challenge from the required domain controller. RadiantOne knows which domain controller to send the request to because of the NT_Domain property that came in the bind request. If the NT_Domain property is not passed, RadiantOne uses the first one configured in the NT Domain property list.\n\n3. Domain controller responds with a challenge. The domain controller generates a challenge, and sends it to RadiantOne.\n\n4. RadiantOne sends the challenge message to client. The challenge message includes an LDAP bind response code 14 (SASL_BIND_IN_PROGRESS). This indicates the server requires the client to send a new bind request, with the same SASL mechanism, to continue the authentication process. \n\n5. Client sends response message. The client then issues a new bind request via GSS-SPNEGO along with an NTLM Type 3 Message {e.g. Username='test5' NT_Domain=‘DOMAINB' }.\n\n6. RadiantOne requests domain controller validate the challenge and response. RadiantOne sends the username, the original challenge, and the response from the client computer to the domain controller. \n\n7. Domain controller compares challenge and response to authenticate user. The domain controller obtains the password hash for the user, and then uses this hash to encrypt the original challenge. Next, the domain controller compares the encrypted challenge with the response from the client computer. If they match, the domain controller sends RadiantOne confirmation that the user is authenticated. Otherwise, user is not authenticated.\n\n8. RadiantOne sends bind response to the client. Assuming valid credentials, RadiantOne grants the client access.\n\nTo enable NTLM:\n\n1. Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > Authentication Methods sub-section.\n\n2. Check the NTLM Authentication option.\n\n3. Each domain that should be supported needs to be configured in this list. The default domain is empty by default and must be configured. Therefore, select the default domain in the list and click **EDIT**.\n\n4. Enter the NT Domain, client principal suffix, Domain Controller IP Address, Domain Controller Host BIOS Name, RadiantOne Computer Account (in the domain), RadiantOne Computer Account Password, IP Range, and configure a client principal name mapping if applicable. An example of NTLM settings is shown below.\n\n![NTLM Domain Controller Configuration](Media/Image3.101.jpg)\n\nFigure 19: NTLM Domain Controller Configuration\n\nMore details about the NT Domain Controller settings can be found below. After you have configured the default domain, click **ADD** to add any additional domains that are required.\n\n>[!note] Changing any of these parameters requires a restart of the RadiantOne service. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.\n\n**NT Domain**\n\nA unique domain name that a client may belong to (connecting to RadiantOne from). If the client is not connecting to RadiantOne from the same domain (or a trusted domain), then their domain must be configured otherwise they cannot connect to RadiantOne.\n\n**Client Principal Suffix**\n\nThe “Kerberos style” realm that corresponds to the above NT domain. \n\n**DC IP Address**\n\nEnter the IP address of the domain controller you configured in the NT Domain property.\n\n**DC Host BIOS Name**\n\nEnter the host name (NETBIOS name) of the machine hosting the NT Domain.\n\n**Computer Account**\n\nRadiantOne must have a service account (defined as a computer account) in the NT Domain. If the RadiantOne host machine joined an Active Directory (AD) domain, the domain controller should have already generated a Computer account for your host. It is under the node \"CN=Computer, DC=`<domain>`\" in AD. However, RadiantOne does not require a physical Computer account to run NTLMv2. It can be a service account but it must be defined under the \"CN=Computers\" container. To create a service/computer account in your NT Domain, from the Active Directory Users and Computers interface, right-click on the \"CN=Computers\" node. Choose 'New' and then click on 'Computer'. Follow the wizard to create a service computer account. \n\nThe Computer Account value you enter in the Main Control Panel must be in format of: `<computer_name>$@<domain>`\ne.g. NTLMv2$@testad.com \n\n**Computer Account Password**\n\nThe password for the RadiantOne service/computer account in the NT Domain should be entered here. Assigning or resetting the password for a computer account can be done with ADSIEdit. From the Active Directory domain controller machine, launch ADSIEdit (run adsiedit.msc). Browse to the Computer account, right click on it, and choose \"Reset Password\". The password can be entered here. Also update this password for the computer account password property in the Main Control Panel.\n\n**IP Range**\n\nThis list defines the IP Addresses for the clients that are authenticated to this configured domain controller. IP Range is required for all configured domains except the default one.\n\nIf the client can send the Domain information to RadiantOne in the Type 1 message, RadiantOne would be able to choose which domain controller to generate the corresponding challenge, which is embedded in the Type 2 message sent back to client. If the client is not able to indicate the Domain in the Type 1 message, RadiantOne references the IP ranges configured and determine the relevant domain. If based on the configured IP ranges (across all configured domains), RadiantOne cannot determine which domain to use, it uses the default one.\n\n**Client Principal Name Mapping**\n\nAfter authentication via NTLM, authorization (access permissions) must be determined. Client Principal Name Mapping can be used to set up a mapping between the user who authenticates using NTLM and a user DN. The DN is required to set access permissions and for RadiantOne to enforce authorization. If no client principal name mappings are configured (or the ones configured fail to link the username to a valid DN in the virtual tree), then RadiantOne allows [anonymous access](access-control#allow-anonymous-access) (you must make sure anonymous access is allowed). To configure the mapping, click **Change** next to the Client Principal Name Mapping parameter.\n\nThere are three different ways to determine the DN from the user ID received in the LDAP bind (using regular expression syntax). Each is described below.\n\n-\tSetting a specific User ID to DN. In this example, if lcallahan were received in the authentication request, RadiantOne would base the authorization on the DN: cn=laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\n\n```\nlcallahan (the user ID) -> (maps to) cn= laura Callahan,cn=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com\n```\n\n- Specify a DN Suffix, replacing the $1 value with the User ID.\n\n```\n(.+) -> uid=$1,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com\n\n(.+) represents the value coming into RadiantOne from the bind operation. If RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan, then the DN it bases authorization on is: uid=lcallahan,ou=people,ou=ssl,dc=com.\n```\n\n-\tSpecify a Base DN, scope of the search, and a search filter to search for the user based on the User ID received in the bind request.\n\n```\n(.+) -> dc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=$1)\n```\n\nIf RadiantOne received a User ID of lcallahan from the bind request, it would issue a search like:\n\n```\ndc=domain1,dc=com??sub?(sAMAccountName=lcallahan)\n```\n\nThe user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identify the user entry in the RadiantOne namespace and to base authorization decisions on.\n\nFor options 2 and 3 described above, multiple variables can be used (not just 1 as described in the examples). Let’s take a look at an example mapping that uses multiple variables:\n\n```\n(.+)@(.+).(.+).com -> ou=$2,dc=$3,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=$1)(dc=$3))\n```\n\nIf RadiantOne received a user ID like laura_callahan@ny.radiant.com, the search that would be issued would look like:\n\n```\nou=ny,dc=radiant,dc=com??sub?(&(uid=laura_callahan)(dc=radiant))\n```\n\nThe user DN returned from the search is used by RadiantOne to identity the user entry in the virtual namespace and to base authorization decisions on.\n\nFor more details, please see [Processing Multiple Mapping Rules](interception#processing-multiple-mapping-rules).\n\nChanging any NTLM-related parameters requires a restart of RadiantOne. Click **Save** prior to restarting. If deployed in a cluster, restart the service on all nodes.\n\n"},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"md5"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"MD5"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If desired, an LDAP client can send RadiantOne a hashed password using Digest MD5 for authentication.
