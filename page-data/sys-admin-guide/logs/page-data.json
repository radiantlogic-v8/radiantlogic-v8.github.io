Logs for the different components are configured in the Log Settings section. RadiantOne access logs are configured in the Access Logs section and RadiantOne changelog is configured in the Changelog section. An introduction to these sections is below. For more details, please see the RadiantOne Logging and Troubleshooting Guide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"log-settings\">Log Settings</h2>\n<p>Log level, rollover size and number of files to keep in archive are configurable for each RadiantOne component. On the Logs > Log Settings section, select the component from the drop-down list. The default log level is INFO. The default rollover size is 100MB and the default number of log files to keep is 10.</p>\n<p>For RadiantOne (FID and Universal Directory), the item in the drop-down list is VDS – Server. The default log file name and location is &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/logs/vds_server.log.</p>\n<p>For VRS (SQL interface to RadiantOne) the items in the drop-down list are VDS -VRS Server and VDS - VRS Access, the default log file names and location are &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/logs/vrs/vrs_server.log and vrs_access.log.</p>\n<p>For the Scheduler, the items in the drop-down list are Scheduler – Scheduler server and Scheduler – Scheduler Tasks.

For details on log levels and advanced log settings, please see the RadiantOne Logging and Troubleshooting Guide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"access-logs\">Access Logs</h2>\n<p>The RadiantOne access log contains details about client requests to RadiantOne and the response. This is a structured log file and the contents can be used for auditing RadiantOne activity. The default output is a text file named vds_server_access.log and is in &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/logs. From the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Logs section > Access Logs, you can indicate the output format. <!--If you want the logs to be written to a database, check the CSV output format. Then, use the RadiantOne Log2DB utility, which reads the CSV log contents and writes them to the database that is configured in the Reporting > Log2DB Settings section.--></p>\n<p>The access log rolls over when it reaches 100MB in size. This size can be set in the Rollover size property. The access logs are kept for 30 days by default and then deleted. This is configurable in the “Rollover: How long to keep the logs” property.</p>\n<!-- \r\nFor more details on the access log including advanced settings for archiving destination and logging into a database, please see the RadiantOne Logging and Troubleshooting Guide.\r\n-->\n<h2 id=\"changelog\">Changelog</h2>\n<p>The changelog is one of the recommended approaches for other processes to detect changes that have happened to RadiantOne entries. The <a href=\"settings-tab#persistent-search-control\">Persistent Search control</a> is the other method that can be used.</p>\n<p>The Changelog can be enabled from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Changelog sub-section. If enabled, the change log stores all modifications made to any entry in the RadiantOne namespace including entries that are stored in <a href=\"cache.md\">persistent cache</a>. The contents of the change log can be viewed below the cn=changelog suffix in the directory.This suffix is indicated in the RadiantOne rootDSE changelog attribute. The <a href=\"settings-tab#rootdse\">rootDSE</a> also contains the firstchangenumber and lastchangenumber attributes. This information can be used by clients as a cursor to track changes.</p>\n<p>Each entry in the changelog is comprised of the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>changeNumber – number that uniquely identifies an entry</li>\n<li>changes – LDIF formatted value that describes the changes made to the entry.</li>\n<li>changeTime – time of the change.</li>\n<li>changeType – type of change: add, modify, delete</li>\n<li>entrydn – DN of the entry that changed.</li>\n<li>objectClass – all entries are associated with top and changelogEntry object classes.</li>\n<li>targetContextId – used internally by RadiantOne for isolation per naming context.</li>\n<li>targetDN - DN of the entry that changed.</li>\n<li>timestampms –used by RadiantOne internally for changelog isolation per naming context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details on these operational attributes, see the RadiantOne Operational Attributes Guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disabling-changelog-for-certain-naming-contexts\">Disabling Changelog for Certain Naming Contexts</h3>\n<p>Changes to entries in certain naming contexts representing certain RadiantOne Universal Directory stores or local persistent cache, are not applicable to logging into change log (e.g. cn=replicationjournal, cn=config…etc.). Other naming contexts that represent backend directories (proxy views to these directories) might not require changelog either. Therefore, these naming contexts can have this function disabled. The list of disabled naming contexts is configured from the Changelog sub-section. Uncheck the Changelog box to disable the naming context.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] In most cases, this setting should not be touched. Only naming contexts representing RadiantOne Universal Directory (HDAP) stores, local persistent cache, or proxy views are shown in the list. Disabling changelog for certain naming contexts should only be done when advised by Radiant Logic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"automatic-backup-of-changelog\">Automatic Backup of Changelog</h3>\n<p>Whenever the RadiantOne service starts, the changelog storage is checked to see if there are enough change numbers left for use (a total of 2 billion numbers are allocated for use). If there is less than 10% of the 2 billion numbers left, the existing records are automatically be rolled over into the corresponding backup storage and the change number will start over at number 1.</p>\n<p>The backup locations are as follows:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag><RLI_HOME>\\vds_server\\data_backup\\most_recent\\db_changelog </codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;RLI_HOME>\\vds_server\\data_backup\\most_recent\\db_changelog </code></pre></div>\n<p>The most_recent\\db_changelog directory contains the most current back up image.</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag><RLI_HOME>\\vds_server\\data_backup\\prev_record\\db_changelog</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;RLI_HOME>\\vds_server\\data_backup\\prev_record\\db_changelog</code></pre></div>\n<p>The prev_record\\db_changelog contains all previous images that have been backed up (prior to the most recent image). The previous images are stored as a precaution in case the most recent image is damaged or unusable.</p>\n<p>While the RadiantOne service running, once the change log number reaches 90% capacity (90% of the allocated 2 billion numbers are used), the following warning message will appear in the RadiantOne log \"!!!  90% change numbers have been used! The VDS should be restarted to prevent any possible exhaust of change number and loss of change records.\" When this message appears, the RadiantOne service should be restarted. If it is not restarted and the entire 2 billion allocated numbers are used, changes are no longer logged into the changelog.</p>\n<h3 id=\"excluded-change-log-attributes\">Excluded Change Log Attributes</h3>\n<p>When entries are changed, the change log reports the attributes under its \"changes\" attribute. This may pose a security risk if sensitive attributes have been changed, and the change log is searchable by outside applications such as sync connectors. To eliminate this risk, the Excluded Change Log Attributes option allows you to exclude selected attributes from members of the “ChangelogAllowedAttributesOnly” group. Though these attributes are logged in the change log, they are not returned for these group members when performing a search on the change log.</p>\n<p>To exclude attributes in changelog searches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the Main Control Panel, click the Directory Browser tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expand cn=config and ou=groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select cn=ChangelogAllowedAttributesOnly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add users and/or groups that you do not want to have access to the “changes” attribute for certain attributes. For more information on adding users and groups, refer to the RadiantOne Namespace Configuration Guide.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Zookeeper tab, expand radiantone/v2/<clustername>/config.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select vds_server.conf.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the pane on the right, find changelogExcludedAttributes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Edit Mode</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the brackets, enter attributes to be excluded in a comma-separated list. Wrap each attribute in double quotes. For example:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>[&quot;mail&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;homePhone&quot;],</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[\"mail\", \"l\", \"homePhone\"],</code></pre></div>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the Save Node button.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When a member of the group searches the changelog, the specified attributes are not included in the “changes” attribute.

The maximum age parameter specifies the number of days an entry stays in storage for the following event stores.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cn=changelog</li>\n<li>cn=cacherefreshlog</li>\n<li>cn=replicationjournal</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] Maximum age also applies to the vdsSyncHist attribute maintained at the level of entries involved in inter-cluster replication. This attribute is multi-valued and continues to grow until the RadiantOne service scans the values and removes ones that are older than the maximum age. RadiantOne scans the values only when the entry is modified. For entries that aren’t updated often, vdsSyncHist will potentially contain values that are older than the maximum age.**</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>cn=localjournal</li>\n<li>cn=tombstone</li>\n<li>stores below cn=queue</li>\n<li>stores below cn=dlqueue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Records older than the maximum age are deleted automatically. Old change log numbers (from deleted records) do not get re-used.</p>\n<p>This parameter is set in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Changelog sub-section. The default value is 3 days which means records are automatically deleted after 3 days.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replication-journal-read-timeout\">Replication Journal Read Timeout</h3>\n<p>This is the number of milliseconds RadiantOne waits to receive a response from the replication journal. When the replication journal read timeout time is exceeded, RadiantOne skips the entry, and the next entry in the replication journal is searched. The next time the RadiantOne node checks the replication journal, it attempts to read the skipped entries.</p>\n<p>This setting is in Zookeeper and can be edited from the Main Control Panel -> ZooKeeper tab at <code class=\"language-radiantone/v2/<clustername\">/config/vds_server.conf</code> (or from command line using the vdsconfig utility). The setting is called “replicationReadTimeoutMS”. The default is 0 (no timeout) meaning that the RadiantOne service waits forever for a response from the query to the replication journal. If the replicationReadTimeMS property is zero and there is a non-zero value for the Operation Timeout in the JNDI Pooling property (Main Control Panel > Settings > Server Backend > Connection Pooling), RadiantOne uses the Operation Timeout value to determine how long to wait for a response when querying the replication journal. If the replicationReadTimeMS property has a non-zero value, then it overrides the Operation Timeout value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"persistent-cache-refresh-log-level\">Persistent Cache Refresh Log Level</h3>\n<p>Activity performed against a persistent cache is logged below a branch in the virtual namespace named cn=cacherefreshlog. This log is always enabled and the level can be set to all, status, or just errors. The level is set on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Changelog sub-section, Persistent Cache Refresh Log Level parameter.</p>\n<p>If all log level is selected, the cn=cacherefreshlog branch contains all requests (successful or not) to refresh the persistent cache. This includes information about the exact changes (what information changed). The attribute named ‘changes’ contains the attribute level changes. The format is compatible with the changelog format.</p>\n<p>The latest IETF description of it is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/directory/ietf-docs/draft-good-ldap-changelog-03.txt\">http://www.mozilla.org/directory/ietf-docs/draft-good-ldap-changelog-03.txt</a></p>\n<p>The ‘changes’ attribute is actually an LDIF representation of the change as defined in:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ietfreport.isoc.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt\">http://ietfreport.isoc.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt</a></p>\n<p>The difference between status level and all level is that all only logs entries that have <strong>actually</strong> changed whereas status level logs all changes coming into the persistent cache whether the actual entry has changed or not. To provide an example, say you have cached data from a materialized view in a database and are using triggers to detect changes on the database. A materialized view may be rebuilt daily, triggering many “changes” detected by the RadiantOne change capture connector. On a more simplistic level, updating an entry with the exact same value results in the connector picking up an update change. Therefore, the persistent cache connector sends a cache refresh to RadiantOne for the entry that was updated.If the cache refresh log level is set to status, this update is logged in the cn=cacherefreshlog. If the cache refresh log level is all, the existing entry in persistent cache is compared with the entry received in the message from the connector, if the entry really has changed, it is stored in the cache refresh log. If the entry did not change, then the “change” is not documented in the cacherefresh log. Because of this, the all log level generates LESS entries in the cn=cacherefreshlog, and documents which attribute actually changed, but is more time consuming because of the comparison required.</p>\n<p>On the Main Control Panel > Directory Browser tab, navigate to the cn=cacherefreshlog branch to view the persistent cache activity.</p>\n<p>The information logged can be used for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To update some other RadiantOne persistent caches that contains the same information.</li>\n<li>As a location where any user/application can review to see what changes were made to the persistent cache and when.</li>\n<li>To monitor errors in case one of the underlying sources is down when RadiantOne attempts to get the latest image.</li>\n<li>To recover from persistent cache update errors without having to reinitialize the persistent cache again. More on this topic can be found in the RadiantOne Operations Guide section titled: Recovering from Persistent Cache Update Errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All changes to persistent cache branches are logged in the <a href=\"#changelog\">change log</a>. Therefore, the persistent cache refresh log level is typically set to error to log only entries that could not be refreshed in the cache. The other log levels are still available to support backward compatibility (when changes to the persistent cache branches were not logged into the general change log).</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the RadiantOne Deployment and Tuning Guide, section titled: Logging Persistent Cache Refreshes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clustermonitor\">Clustermonitor</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"clusters-tab#dashboard-tab\">Server Control Panel > Dashboard tab</a>, displays a variety of aspects related to a given RadiantOne node. The graphs display CPU usage, JVM memory usage, disk space usage, disk latency and number of client connections. To use the dashboard tab for monitoring, the cluster monitor store must be enabled. This parameter is set in the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Clustermonitor sub-section. Select the enabled option and enter a max age (in hours). The default is 72 hours, meaning the statistics displayed cover the past 3 days.</p>\n<h3 id=\"statistics\">Statistics</h3>\n<p>RadiantOne logs statistics related to operations it receives. This includes average execution time, peak execution time, and whether the operation was successful. No actual data (entires/attributes) is logged, only metadata. This log is primarily for Radiant Logic support to have key information to assist with troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>This logging is enabled by default and can be managed from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Statistics > Statistics Analyzer Settings sub-section. The log location is &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/logs/stats.log. This logging is enabled by default and calculates statistics during 1 minute intervals prior to saving to the stats.log.</p>\n<p>For each RadiantOne Universal Directory store or persistent cache initialization, statistics are calculated for the total number of entries and sub-categorized by branches and object classes. The average and peak number of attributes per entry, and the average and peak size (in KB) per entry are also calculated. This information is logged into the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>/vds_server/logs/stats.log. This logging is enabled by default and can be managed from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Statistics > Init Statistics Settings sub-section.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"logs"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Logs"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"RadiantOne supports logging at different levels for different components.
