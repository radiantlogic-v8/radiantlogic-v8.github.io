This provides you with some base performance numbers. Then, run SLAMD against the RadiantOne service (on the branch built from the underlying LDAP source). You should keep in mind that the following additional configurations on your RadiantOne branch could impact performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Joins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interception scripts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cache</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Referral Chasing (as a client, RadiantOne FID could chase referrals returned from the backends)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Network delays</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any logging enabled – for performance testing, logs should be either turned off or reduced to a minimum level.
