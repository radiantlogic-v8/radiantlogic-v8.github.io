It is recommended that it runs as a service in production environments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE – When deploying in a cluster, the first node in the cluster is the leader node.

If it is, you must start/stop the service directly from the OS services window.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE – If the RadiantOne service is started from the Dashboard tab, the process is killed when the user logs off the machine. Start RadiantOne as a Windows service to avoid this problem.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"as-a-windows-service\">As a Windows Service</h3>\n<p>Once you have tested your virtual views and are ready to deploy your architecture, the RadiantOne service can be configured to start as a Windows service. Configure it as a Windows service with the following steps. Perform these steps on the RadiantOne leader node first (if you are running in a cluster). If you are not running in a cluster, perform these steps on any server in your classic architecture.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure that the RadiantOne service is stopped if it is currently running.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\bin\\windows.service directory. You will find fid-server-service-install.bat and fid-server-service-uninstall.bat. These files install RadiantOne as a service and uninstall the service respectively.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE – if you are running RadiantOne on Windows 7, 2008, 2012, or 2016 you should execute fid-server-service-install or fid-server-service-uninstall as an administrator.

A command window opens briefly and then closes. Check your services window (refresh if it was already open) and you should see a new service for the RadiantOne Server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the RadiantOne service (be sure to start the leader node first if you are deploying a cluster).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) If a local ZooKeeper is deployed (instead of an external ZooKeeper ensemble), reboot the machine to ensure ZooKeeper also starts as a service along with the RadiantOne service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repeat steps 1-5 on all nodes (if deploying in a cluster) or on all other servers if deployed in a classic architecture.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"uninstalling-the-windows-service\">Uninstalling the Windows Service</h4>\n<p>To uninstall the Windows service, stop the service and execute &#x3C;RLI_HOME>\\ \\bin\\windows.service\\fid-server-service-uninstall.bat. The process of uninstalling RadiantOne as a Windows service does not update the setting in ZooKeeper. Therefore, the Dashboard tab in the Main Control Panel does not properly display the stop/start options for the RadiantOne service since it assumes it is still configured to run as a service. To address this, manually update the asAService property in ZooKeeper. There are two methods you can choose from.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>From the Main Control Panel, switch to <a href=\"00-preface#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>. Go to the Settings tab and navigate to Server Front End -> Advanced. Uncheck the Run as a Window Service option and save the configuration. Restart the Control Panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use the vdsconfig utility to update the asAService property to false. Below is an example. After running the command, restart the Control Panel.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>C:\\radiantone\\vds\\bin>vdsconfig.bat set-property -name asAService -value false \r\nUsing RLI home : C:\\radiantone\\vds \r\nUsing Java home : C:\\radiantone\\vds\\jdk\\jre \r\n0 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManagerConnectionStateLis \r\ntener - Curator connection state change: CONNECTED \r\n9 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManagerConnectionStateLis \r\ntener - VDS-ZK connection state changed: CONNECTED \r\n9 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManager - ZooManager con \r\nnection state changed: CONNECTED \r\nPrevious value: true \r\nNew value: false \r\nConfiguration has been updated successfully.</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">C:\\radiantone\\vds\\bin>vdsconfig.bat set-property -name asAService -value false \r\nUsing RLI home : C:\\radiantone\\vds \r\nUsing Java home : C:\\radiantone\\vds\\jdk\\jre \r\n0 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManagerConnectionStateLis \r\ntener - Curator connection state change: CONNECTED \r\n9 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManagerConnectionStateLis \r\ntener - VDS-ZK connection state changed: CONNECTED \r\n9 [ConnectionStateManager-0] WARN com.rli.zookeeper.ZooManager - ZooManager con \r\nnection state changed: CONNECTED \r\nPrevious value: true \r\nNew value: false \r\nConfiguration has been updated successfully.</code></pre></div>\n<h3 id=\"as-a-linux-daemon\">As a LINUX Daemon</h3>\n<p>On UNIX platforms, the RadiantOne service can be started with $RLI_HOME/bin/runVDSServer.sh.</p>\n<p>Once you have tested your configuration and are ready to deploy your architecture, the RadiantOne service can be configured to start as a Linux Daemon.
