The Wizards tab, the Context Builder tab, and the Directory Namespace tab. Although the tuning parameters are typically the same no matter which tab you use, the location to set the parameter may be different. This chapter describes the possible tuning parameters and how to configure them depending on which tool you used to create the virtual views.\r\nVirtual Views Created in the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace or Wizards tabs\r\nDetails about the parameters mentioned below can be found in the RadiantOne System Administration Guide. This document is only for pointing out these parameters as key to review when tuning.\r\nDatabase Backends\r\nDatabase backends are any source accessed via JDBC or ODBC. This includes Oracle, SQL Server, and IBM DB2 among others.\r\nOptimize the View Definition\r\nCase Sensitivity for Searches\r\nThere are three options available for handling case sensitive databases. These options are related to how RadiantOne FID generates the query to send to the database. These options are available on the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace Tab. Select the container/content node in a virtual view below Root Naming Contexts and on the right side, select the Advanced Settings tab.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As Is</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your database is not case sensitive, then you should choose the As Is option. With this option, RadiantOne FID forwards the search filter to the backend in the exact case it was received in the request from the client.  This is the default option.</p>\n<p>If your database is case sensitive and you choose this option, the case received in the filter from the client search request must match the case used in the database or else the entry will not be found.\r\nFor example, if a database attribute named FIRSTNAME had a value of Nancy, and RadiantOne FID received a search request with a filter of (firstname=nancy), the entry would not be returned. The client must use a filter of (firstname=Nancy) in order for the entry to be properly returned from the database.\r\n2)\tIgnore Case\r\nIf your database is case sensitive and you are not sure how the values are stored (mixed case, all upper, all lower…etc.), then you should choose the Ignore Case option. With this option, RadiantOne FID generates the SQL query so that both the filter that was received in the client request and the values from the backend are converted into uppercase before the search filter can be validated.  For example, if a client sent a request with a filter of (firstname=Nancy), RadiantOne FID would generate the following where clause based on the filter received in the client request.\r\nWHERE (UPPER(APP.EMPLOYEES.FIRSTNAME)=UPPER('Nancy'))\r\nThe case used in the filter from the client is irrelevant and everything is converted into uppercase.\r\nThis option offers the least performance, so it should only be used when absolutely required. If the database is case sensitive and the values are stored in uppercase, you should use the Translate Values to Uppercase option (see #3 below) as it is more efficient.\r\n3)\tTranslate Values to Uppercase\r\nIf your database is case sensitive and you know the values are stored in uppercase, you should choose the Translate Values to Uppercase option. With this option, RadiantOne FID translates the search filter value into uppercase before sending it to the backend database. This option is more efficient than the Ignore Case option mentioned above.\r\nModify the Exposed Attributes\r\nTo improve the performance of the view, you should only expose the required attributes. The default behavior of RadiantOne FID is to request all attributes from the underlying source (no matter what specific attributes a client may have requested).  Having unnecessary attributes in the output can slow down the performance of the query (because it makes the query string much longer). On the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace tab, select the container/content node in the virtual view below Root Naming Contexts and on the right side, select the Attributes tab. Only list the attributes on the Attributes tab that you want RadiantOne FID to request from the backend (delete all others).</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 1: Modifying the attributes in the View Definition</p>\n<p>Index Attributes Used in Joins\r\nIf joins are configured, verify that all attributes conditioning the join are indexed in the underlying sources.  In the example shown below, the join is based on employeeID in the source matches employeeNumber in the target. This means employeeID should be indexed in the source and employeeNumber should be indexed in the target.</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 2: Join Profile</p>\n<p>Other Possible Optimizations\r\nDepending on your specific use case and virtual view, two other optimizations are possible.  These are configured on the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace Tab. Select the container/content node in the virtual view below Root Naming Contexts and on the right side, select the Advanced Settings tab. Both options are described below.</p>\n<p>Request Binary/BLOB Attributes Only When Necessary\r\nRequesting BLOB attributes can significantly decrease performance. When this option is enabled, RadiantOne FID requests binary/BLOB attributes from the backend only if they are specifically requested by the client.<br>\nUse caution when enabling this parameter if an interception script is defined (which may need such attributes even if they are not requested by the client).\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE - Do not enable this option if a memory entry cache is used (as the whole virtual entry is needed, including the BLOBs).<br>\nProcess Joins and Computed Attributes Only When Necessary\r\nThe default behavior of RadiantOne FID is to process associated joins and build computed attributes whenever a virtual object is reached from a query regardless of whether the attributes requested come from a secondary source or computation.<br>\nIf you enable this option, RadiantOne FID does not perform joins or computations if a client requests or searches for attributes from a primary object only.  If a client requests or searches for attributes from secondary objects or computed attributes, then RadiantOne FID processes the join(s) and computations accordingly.\r\nUse caution when enabling this option if you have interception scripts defined on these objects, or access controls based on filters are being used (both of which may require other attributes returned from secondary sources or computations regardless of whether or not the client requested or searched for them).\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE - Do not enable this option if a memory entry cache is used (as the whole virtual entry is needed for the cache).\r\nConnection Pooling\r\nConnection pooling improves performance because a connection to the underlying source does not need to be created every time data needs to be retrieved.\r\nConnection pooling for database sources is automatically enabled by default and the settings can be modified in the Main Control Panel -> Settings tab -> Server Backend section, under the Connection Pooling sub section (requires Expert Mode).</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 3: Connection Pooling Settings</p>\n<p>The possible settings are described in more details below.\r\nPool Size\r\nThe maximum number of connections that are held in the pool for each JDBC data source. The default is 20.\r\nIdle Timeout\r\nThis is the maximum number of minutes to keep an idle connection in the pool. The default is 15. Setting this value to “0” means the opened connection stays in the pool forever.\r\nPrepared Statement Cache\r\nRadiantOne uses parameterized SQL statements and maintains a cache of the most used SQL prepared statements. The default is 50. This improves performance by reducing the number of times the database SQL engine parses and prepares SQL.\r\nThis setting is per database connection.\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE - Use caution when changing this default value as not all databases have the same limits on the number of 'active' prepared statements allowed.\r\nLDAP Backends\r\nLDAP backends are any source accessed via LDAP.  This includes Sun Java Directory, IBM Directory Server, and Active Directory among others.\r\nDisable Referral Chasing\r\nBy default, RadiantOne FID does not attempt to chase referrals that have been configured in the underlying LDAP server.</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 4: Disabling Referral Chasing</p>\n<p>Chasing referrals can affect the overall performance because if the referral server is not responding (or responding slowly) RadiantOne FID could take a long time to respond to the client. For example, in the case of querying an underlying Active Directory (with a base DN starting at the root of Active Directory) you may get entries like the following returned:\r\nldaps://ForestDnsZones.na.radiantlogic.com:636…\r\nldaps://DomainDnsZones.na.radiantlogic.com:636…\r\nIf RadiantOne FID attempts to “chase” these referrals, this can result in an extreme degradation in response times.  Therefore, it is recommended that referral chasing is disabled, especially if you need to connect to Active Directory starting at the root of the tree.\r\nExcluded Attributes for Active Directory Backends\r\nThis parameter is for Active Directory backends. It excludes specific attributes from being returned from the backend. Certain “system” attributes (e.g. dscorepropagationdata) returned from Active Directory (even for non-admin users) can cause problems for building persistent cache because the data type is not handled properly, and these attributes need to be added to the RadiantOne schema for the local HDAP storage to handle them in the cache. Also, these attributes cause problems for the change capture connector needed for real-time persistent cache refresh to work properly. Attributes that are not required by client applications, should be added to this list to ensure they are not returned in the view from Active Directory. By default, the AD attributes that are excluded are ds*, acs*, ms* and frs* (* is a wildcard meaning that any attributes with those prefixes are excluded). Any attributes that you do not want returned from the backend Active Directory can be added to the Attributes excluded from search results (support for Active Directory) list which is found on the Main Control Panel-> Settings tab -> Server Front End section -> Attributes Handling sub-section. Make sure a space separates the attributes listed.\r\nOptimize the View Definition\r\nInclude &#x26; Exclude Filters\r\nMultiple different LDAP backends can be configured below the same root naming context.  Therefore, client applications have the ability to perform searches from the root which could result in querying numerous backend directories.  Sometimes, this can affect performance.  In order to have more control over which LDAP queries get sent to which LDAP backends, RadiantOne offers inclusion and exclusion search filters.<br>\n\tInclusion Filters: Allow you to specify which filters are allowed to be sent to the backend LDAP directory.\r\n\tExclusion Filters: Allow you to specify which filters are not allowed to be sent to the backend LDAP directory.\r\nTypically you would specify one or the other (inclusion filters or exclusion filters).  The filter can be in the form of any valid LDAP filter.  Also, different filters can apply on different search scopes (base, one level, or subtree).\r\nIndex Attributes Used in Joins\r\nIf joins are configured, verify that all attributes conditioning the join are indexed in the underlying sources.\r\nOther Possible Optimizations\r\nDepending on your specific use case and virtual view, two other optimizations are possible.  These are configured on the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace Tab. Select the virtual view below the Root Naming Contexts node. On the right side, select the Advanced Proxy tab.  Both options are described below.</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 5: Optimizations for LDAP Backends\r\nLimit Attributes Requested from the LDAP Backend\r\nWhenever RadiantOne FID queries a backend LDAP, the default behavior is to ask for all attributes (although ONLY the attributes requested in the query are returned to the client).  This default behavior is for the following reasons:\r\n\tJoins have been configured and the filter in the search request involves attributes from both the primary and secondary sources (i.e. the query filter contains conditions on both primary and secondary objects).\r\n\tInterception scripts that involve logic based on attributes from the backend.  These attributes may not be specifically requested or searched for by the client. However, RadiantOne FID must retrieve them from the backend in order for the script logic to be valid.\r\n\tACL checking. You can setup ACLs on attribute/values of an entry (i.e. mystatus=hidden), so RadiantOne FID may need the whole entry to check the authorization.\r\n\tFor entry caching. The entire entry needs to be in the entry cache.\r\nIf your virtual view does not require any of the conditions mentioned above, you can enable this option for better performance.  If this option is enabled, RadiantOne FID queries the backend server only for attributes requested from the client in addition to attributes set as 'Always Requested' on the Attributes tab.\r\nProcess Joins and Computed Attributes Only When Necessary\r\nThe default behavior of RadiantOne FID is to process associated joins and build computed attributes whenever a virtual object is reached from a query regardless of whether the attributes requested come from a secondary source or computation.<br>\nIf you enable this option, RadiantOne FID does not perform joins or computations when a client requests or searches for attributes from a primary object only.  If a client requests or searches for attributes from secondary objects or computed attributes, then RadiantOne FID processes the join(s) and computations accordingly.\r\nUse caution when enabling this option if you have interception scripts defined on these objects, or access controls based on filters are being used (both of which may require other attributes returned from secondary sources or computations regardless of whether or not the client requested or searched for them).\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE - Do not enable this option if a memory entry cache is used (as the whole virtual entry is needed for the cache).\r\nUse Client Size Limit Value to Query Backend\r\nWhenever RadiantOne FID queries a backend LDAP, the default behavior is to ask for all entries (sizelimit=0) even if the client indicates a size limit.\r\nThis default behavior is because the entries returned by the backend are possible candidates, but may not be retained for the final result that is sent to the client. For example, if an ACL has been defined in RadiantOne, not all entries from the backend may be authorized for the user (connected to FID) to access. Other cases are when joins or interception scripts are involved with the virtual view, these may also alter the entries that match the client’s search.\r\nTo limit the number of entries from the backend, using paging is the recommended approach. If the backend supports paging, RadiantOne FID will not get all the results at once, only one page at a time (page size indicated in the configuration). In this case, if RadiantOne FID has returned to the client the size limit required, it will not go to the next page.\r\nIf your virtual view does not require any of the conditions mentioned above (joins, interceptions, ACL), and using paging between RadiantOne FID and the backend is not possible, you can enable this option to limit the number of entries requested from the backend.  If this option is enabled, RadiantOne FID uses the size limit specified by the client instead of using sizelimit=0 when querying the backend.\r\nUse Client Time Limit Value to Query Backend\r\nWhenever RadiantOne FID queries a backend LDAP, the default behavior is to request no time limit (timelimit=0) even if the client indicates a time limit.\r\nIf you want RadiantOne FID to utilize the time limit value it receives from the client request when it queries the backend directory, set enableLdapServerTimeLimit = true; in ZooKeeper.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the Main Control Panel, switch to expert mode and then go to the Zookeeper tab.</li>\n<li>On the Zookeeper tab, navigate to radiantone/v1/cluster/config/vds_server.conf.</li>\n<li>Click Edit Mode.</li>\n<li>Search for \"enableLdapServerTimeLimit\" : false, and change false to true.</li>\n<li>Click Save.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If enableLdapServerTimeLimit is set to true, RadiantOne FID uses the time limit specified by the client instead of using timelimit=0 when querying the backend.\r\nConnection Pooling\r\nJNDI connection pooling to a backend LDAP source is enabled by default.\r\nTo change the maximum connections to maintain in the pool, the idle timeout, or connection timeout, simply change the setting from the Main Control Panel -> Settings tab ->Server Backend section -> Connection Pooling sub-section (requires Expert Mode).\r\nPool Size\r\nDefault is 1000. This is the maximum number of concurrent connections by RadiantOne FID to each LDAP source. For example, if you have four LDAP sources and your maximum connections value is set to 200, then you could have up to a total of 800 LDAP connections maintained by RadiantOne FID.\r\nTimeout\r\nDefault is 7. This is the maximum number of seconds RadiantOne FID waits while trying to establish a connection to the backend LDAP server. There are two attempts to create a connection (7 seconds per attempt).\r\nOperation Timeout\r\nDefault is 0 (no timeout). This is the maximum number of seconds RadiantOne FID waits to receive a response from to the backend LDAP server.  After this time, RadiantOne FID drops the request and tries to send the request again. After two failed attempts to get a response back, RadiantOne FID returns an error to the client.\r\nWrite Operation Timeout\r\nThe default is 0 (no timeout). This is the maximum number of seconds RadiantOne FID waits to receive a response from to the backend LDAP server for a write operation. After this time, RadiantOne FID drops the request and attempts to send the request again. After two failed attempts to get a response back, RadiantOne FID returns an error to the client.\r\nIdle Timeout\r\nDefault is 5. This is the maximum number of minutes to keep an idle connection in the pool. Setting this value to “0” means the opened connection stays in the pool forever.\r\nVirtual Views Created in the Main Control Panel -> Context Builder Tab\r\nDetails about the parameters mentioned below can be found in the Context Builder Guide. This document is only for pointing out these parameters as key to review when tuning RadiantOne FID.\r\nDatabase Backends\r\nDatabase backends are any source accessed via JDBC or ODBC. This includes Oracle, SQL Server, and IBM DB2 among others.\r\nOptimize the View Definition\r\nCase Sensitivity for Searches\r\nThere are three options available for handling case sensitive databases.  These options are related to how RadiantOne FID generates the query to send to the database and are available on the Advanced Settings tab when the relevant database object node is selected in the view definition of the View Designer perspective.</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 6: Search Options for Virtual Views of Database Backends</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As Is</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your database is not case sensitive, then you should choose the As Is option. With this option, RadiantOne FID forwards the search filter to the backend in the exact case it was received in the request from the client.  This is the default option.</p>\n<p>If your database is case sensitive and you choose this option, the case received in the filter from the client search request must match the case used in the database or else the entry is not found.\r\nFor example, if a database attribute named FIRSTNAME had a value of Nancy, and RadiantOne FID received a search request with a filter of (firstname=nancy), the entry is not returned. The client must use a filter of (firstname=Nancy) for the entry to be properly returned from the database.\r\n2)\tIgnore Case\r\nIf your database is case-sensitive and you are not sure how the values are stored (mixed case, all upper, all lower…etc.), then choose the Ignore Case option. With this option, RadiantOne FID generates the SQL query so that both the filter that was received in the client request and the values from the backend are converted into uppercase before the search filter can be validated.

Having unnecessary attributes in the output can slow down the performance of the query (because it makes the query string much longer).\r\nOn the Attributes tab, remove any attributes (from the column on the right side) that are not relevant/required.</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 7: Attributes Defined for the Virtual View\r\nIndex Attributes Used in External Joins\r\nIf joins are configured, verify that all attributes conditioning the join are indexed in the underlying sources.\r\nFor example, in the virtual view shown in the three screen shots below, three external joins are configured. The attributes conditioning the joins are cn, mail, and employeeID. These attributes must be indexed in their respective sources. Otherwise, performance can be unpredictable.</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 8: Join Based on CN Attribute Matching the FULLNAME Attribute</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 9: Join Based on EMAILADDRESS Attribute Matching the ADDRESS Attribute</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 10: Join Based on EMPLOYEEID Attribute\r\nOther Possible Optimizations\r\nDepending on your specific use case and virtual view, two other optimizations are possible.  These are configured on the Advanced tab for the selected database object in the View Definition of the View Designer perspective.

To confirm chasing referrals is disabled, ensure that the Disable Referral Chasing property is checked when you define the LDAP data source.</p>\n<p>Figure 3. 12: Disabling Referral Chasing\r\nChasing referrals can affect the overall performance of RadiantOne FID because if the referral server is not responding (or responding slowly) it could take a long time to respond to the client.

Therefore, it is recommended that referral chasing is disabled, especially if you need to connect to Active Directory starting at the root of the tree.\r\nExcluded Attributes for Active Directory Backends\r\nThis parameter is for Active Directory backends. It excludes specific attributes from being returned from the backend. Certain “system” attributes (e.g. dscorepropagationdata) returned from Active Directory (even for non-admin users) can cause problems for building persistent cache because the data type is not handled properly, and these attributes need to be added to the RadiantOne schema for the local HDAP storage to handle them in the cache. Also, these attributes cause problems for the change capture connector needed for real-time persistent cache refresh to work properly. Attributes that are not required by client applications, should be added to this list to ensure they are not returned in the view from Active Directory. By default, the AD attributes that are excluded are ds*, acs*, ms* and frs* (* is a wildcard meaning that any attributes with those prefixes are excluded). Any attributes that you do not want returned from the backend Active Directory can be added to the Attributes excluded from search results (support for Active Directory) list which is found on the Main Control Panel-> Settings tab -> Server Front End section -> Attributes Handling sub-section.

This default behavior is for the following reasons:\r\n\tJoins have been configured and the filter in the search request involves attributes from both the primary and secondary sources (i.e. the query filter contains conditions on both primary and secondary objects).\r\n\tInterception scripts that involve logic based on attributes from the backend.  These attributes may not be specifically requested or searched for by the client. However, RadiantOne FID must retrieve them from the backend in order for the script logic to be valid.\r\n\tACL checking. You can setup ACLs on attribute/values of an entry (i.e. mystatus=hidden), so RadiantOne FID may need the whole entry to check the authorization.\r\n\tFor entry caching. The entire entry needs to be in the entry cache.\r\nIf your virtual view does not require any of the conditions mentioned above, you can enable this option for better performance.

For example, if an ACL has been defined in RadiantOne, not all entries from the backend may be authorized for the user (connected to FID) to access. Other cases are when joins or interception scripts are involved with the virtual view, these may also alter the entries that match the client’s search.\r\nTo limit the number of entries from the backend, using paging is the recommended approach. If the backend supports paging, RadiantOne FID will not get all the results at once, only one page at a time (page size indicated in the configuration). In this case, if RadiantOne FID has returned to the client the size limit required, it will not go to the next page.\r\nIf your virtual view does not require any of the conditions mentioned above (joins, interceptions, ACL), and using paging between RadiantOne FID and the backend is not possible, you can enable this option to limit the number of entries requested from the backend.

With this option, RadiantOne FID generates the SQL query so that both the filter that was received in the client request and the values from the backend are converted into uppercase before the search filter can be validated.  For example, if a client sent a request with a filter of (firstname=Nancy), RadiantOne FID would generate the following where clause based on the filter received in the client request.\r\nWHERE (UPPER(APP.EMPLOYEES.FIRSTNAME)=UPPER('Nancy'))\r\nThe case used in the filter from the client is irrelevant and everything is converted into uppercase.\r\nThis option offers the least performance, so it should only be used when absolutely required.
