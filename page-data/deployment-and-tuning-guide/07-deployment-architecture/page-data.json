After this node is installed and configured as needed (e.g. virtual views, persistent cache, global synchronization, Universal Directory stores…etc.), additional RadiantOne nodes can be installed on other machines. During the install of additional nodes, they can join the existing cluster and benefit from the current configuration and get a replica of the data (Universal Directory stores and persistent cache). The configuration management and allocation of which node becomes the new <a href=\"#the-radiantone-service\">RadiantOne leader</a> (should the current leader node fail) is handled automatically by ZooKeeper. Configuration changes made on any of the nodes are shared across all nodes in the cluster. For more details, see the RadiantOne Installation Guide.</p>\n<p>Any new Universal Directory stores or persistent caches that have been initialized on the leader node are automatically replicated out to all follower and follower-only nodes in the cluster. Replication across cluster nodes is based on a binary copy of data files across the cluster's nodes (from leader to followers/followers-only). Every time a Universal Directory store or persistent cache is modified on the leader, new segments are created leaving existing ones untouched. The RadiantOne followers/follower-only copy the new binary files locally to update their image.</p>\n<p>When a new follower/follower-only joins a cluster, a full copy of each persistent cache is done when the RadiantOne service starts. This operation leverages the Admin HTTP Service configured for the embedded web server in RadiantOne. The Admin HTTP ports can be seen on the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Server Front End section > Administration sub-section (requires <a href=\"00-preface#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] The HTTP port should never be turned off as it is used by the replication process that keeps data synchronized and some configuration files synchronized across all nodes in a given cluster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All naming contexts that are defined as a Universal Directory store are automatically configured for replication across the cluster nodes. The following default stores are used internally by RadiantOne and automatically replicated across all cluster nodes:</p>\n<p>cn=config\r\ncn=changelog\r\ncn=cacherefreshlog\r\ncn=extendedxjoin\r\ncn=queue\r\ncn=dlqueue\r\ncn=localjournal\r\ncn=replicationjournal\r\ncn=system-registry\r\ncn=registry</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-radiantone-service\">The RadiantOne Service</h3>\n<p>Within a cluster, the nodes are designated as “leader” or “follower” and the status of each node is registered in <a href=\"#zookeeper\">ZooKeeper</a>. There is only one leader node and one or more follower nodes at any given time.</p>\n<p>The RadiantOne cluster supports read and write operations from clients. All write operations received by nodes designated as “followers” are redirected to the designated “leader” node. The changes are made on the leader node and then replicated out to the follower nodes. This is depicted in the diagram below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The leader node is responsible for handling all write operations from clients and all persistent cache refresh (periodic or real-time) operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 592px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50.4%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/47f30d7de59aa5d6ba78e913e6c31968/694d5/Image7.2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/47f30d7de59aa5d6ba78e913e6c31968/bf173/Image7.2.jpg 375w,\n/static/47f30d7de59aa5d6ba78e913e6c31968/694d5/Image7.2.jpg 592w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 7.2: Replication Flow within a Cluster</p>\n<p><strong>High Availability</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure your federated identity service is highly available for client applications, deploy two or more RadiantOne nodes in addition to a hardware load balancer to distribute load and handle failover for these servers.

If only the RadiantOne process fails on the machine, the administrator can be alerted via email by leveraging the RadiantOne monitoring capabilities. For details on monitoring RadiantOne, please see the RadiantOne Monitoring and Reporting Guide.</p>\n<p>The administrator should troubleshoot the failure and restart the RadiantOne service. Once the process has restarted, it automatically connects to the leader node and picks up all data changes (Universal Directory stores or persistent cache) that occurred while it was down (via block replication). The hardware router should failback and again distribute the client load accordingly.</p>\n<p>If the RadiantOne service failed on the leader node, a new node takes over as leader and registers in ZooKeeper. For persistent cache, the refresh process only runs on the leader node. Therefore, when a RadiantOne leader node fails, a new node takes over managing the persistent cache refresh process.

All cluster installation steps are described in the RadiantOne Installation Guide. Once this new machine starts up, the new RadiantOne node pulls the data from the current leader node automatically. The failed node that is unable to be recovered can be manually removed from the cluster configuration. Please see the RadiantOne Operations Guide for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zookeeper\">ZooKeeper</h3>\n<p>A RadiantOne cluster is managed by ZooKeeper which is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information. A server configuration change made on any of the RadiantOne nodes in the cluster is automatically shared across all nodes. In addition, ZooKeeper manages the RadiantOne nodes in regard to which is the leader and which are the follower nodes. Should the RadiantOne leader node fail, one of the other core nodes takes over and registers in ZooKeeper as the new leader.</p>\n<p><strong>High Availability</strong></p>\n<p>In production, to ensure high availability, the ZooKeeper service is deployed in an ensemble of at least 3 nodes, which is external to the RadiantOne cluster. With a 3-node ensemble, the ensemble can support the failure of one ZooKeeper process/machine. With a 5-node ensemble, two ZooKeeper processes/machine failures are supported. When ZooKeeper loses contact with over half of the other ZooKeeper servers in the ensemble, it enters a read-only mode. This is the default behavior and allows the RadiantOne service to continue to process search operations even when the ZooKeeper quorum is lost. However, the RadiantOne service will deny any write operations by returning LDAP error code 53: Unwilling to Perform to the client. Also, no configuration changes can be made while ZooKeeper is in this state. Administrators cannot login to the Control Panel during this time. If an administrator is logged into the Control Panel when ZooKeeper enters read-only mode, a warning message appears at the top and no configuration changes are allowed. To recover from read-only mode, make sure ZooKeeper is restarted on over half of the cluster nodes. Once the quorum is re-established, the RadiantOne cluster recovers automatically.</p>\n<p>As an alternative to the default read-only mode, ZooKeeper can be configured for SHUTDOWN mode when the quorum is lost. In this case, the RadiantOne service on all cluster nodes shuts down. This might be preferable if multiple clusters are deployed because the load balancer in front of the cluster nodes (that are in READ_ONLY state due to ZooKeeper failures) will detect that no RadiantOne services are available and failover to another cluster/site. To configure this behavior, set the onZkWriteLossVdsServerBehavior to a value of SHUTDOWN. This can be set from the Main Control Panel -> Zookeeper tab (requires <a href=\"00-preface#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>). From the Zookeeper tab, navigate to /radiantone/<version>/&#x3C;cluster_name>/config/vds_server.conf and click <strong>Edit Mode</strong>. Locate the “onZkWriteLossVdsServerBehavior” property and replace the default value (READ_ONLY) with SHUTDOWN. If the property is not listed, add it.

After the first migration, you should keep the production environment updated with configuration changes by following the steps detailed in the RadiantOne Operations Guide.</p>\n<p>As you migrate from a development environment to QA and finally to production, the following items should be considered.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Installing RadiantOne (same exact version/buildID or newer version used in the environment you are migrating from is required).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Migrating Configuration Files</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) If the target RadiantOne version is newer, manually copy the custom project folder to the target machine and rebuild the jar files. If the target RadiantOne version is the exact same version/buildID as the source machine, the custom project is migrated automatically.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing Server Certificates</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Installing Servers to Run as Services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Modifying Connection Strings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changing Log levels</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewing Interception Scripts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increasing RadiantOne Memory</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configuring and Initializing Persistent Cache</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configuring Monitoring</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) Configuring Inter-Cluster Replication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) If Global Identity Builder is used, perform an upload of identities into the global profile and configure persistent cache. See RadiantOne Global Identity Builder Guide.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) Enabling FIPS Mode. See RadiantOne FIPS Mode Guide.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) Configure multiple instances of RadiantOne.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each step is described in more details below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installing-radiantone\">Installing RadiantOne</h3>\n<p>Install RadiantOne on the first production machine. All machines must have either the same version/build ID (or a newer patch release), and the same port settings that were used in the development/QA environment that you are migrating from. The ports can be updated in the target environment after migration if needed. Do not try to upgrade the RadiantOne version (e.g. moving from v7.3 to v7.4) when migrating to production.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] the admin passwords for the RadiantOne administrator (e.g. cn=directory manager), and ZooKeeper administrator that were defined during installation are not impacted in the migration of configuration. The passwords that were defined in the target environment are not overwritten when the configuration is imported.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Typically, you should plan on having between 2-5 RadiantOne servers running in a production cluster. After installing the first RadiantOne node, import the configuration from the QA environment onto this node. Steps for this are detailed in <a href=\"#migrating-configuration---migration-utility\">Migrating Configuration</a> section. Then, proceed to install the other nodes of the cluster. This way they automatically inherit the configuration.</p>\n<p>During the install, the first RadiantOne node establishes the cluster name. Then, when installing additional nodes, they join the existing cluster.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] To ensure proper access permissions are used, the same operating system user account name should be used to install RadiantOne on all machines playing a role in migration. For example, on Windows platforms, an Administrator account must install RadiantOne on all machines. Then, during migration, launch the Migration Utility as this user. On Linux platforms, the user account used to launch the Migration Utility should be the one that installed RadiantOne.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"migrating-configuration---migration-utility\">Migrating Configuration - Migration Utility</h3>\n<p>The RadiantOne configuration is stored in various files which makes the task of manual migration a painful and error prone process. The Migration Utility automates the process of moving the configuration files from one RadiantOne machine/cluster to another. The configuration can be exported from one machine/cluster and imported into another. The export needs to happen on only one node in a cluster (as all nodes share the same config) and only needs to be imported on one node in the cluster of the new environment.</p>\n<p>After installing RadiantOne on the production machine, migrate the configuration files from Development/QA.\r\nTo use the migration utility to export the configuration from the Development/QA server and import it into the production machine, follow the steps below which are sufficient for most cases. If you want greater granularity over what data and virtual views are migrated, you can customize the migration plan. For details on customizing the migration plan, see the RadiantOne Migration Utility Guide.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Download the latest migration utility (at least v2.1) from the Radiant Logic support site and unzip it on both the source machine (from where you are exporting) and the target machine (where you plan on importing). Contact Support (<a href=\"mailto:support@radiantlogic.com\">support@radiantlogic.com</a>) for credentials and location of the Migration Utility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Development/QA machine, lock configuration changes to ensure no changes are being made while the configuration is exported. Log into the Main Control Panel as a directory administrator and go to Settings tab -> Configuration -> Configuration Lock and toggle the option to the Locked position. Click Save.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the primary/source machine, from a command prompt navigate to the location where you unzipped the migration utility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run the following command (modifying the version of the migration tool and the location of the export file to match your needs):</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>C:\\r1\\migration\\radiantone-migration-tool-2.1.0\\migrate.bat export C:/tmp/export.zip</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<p>Copy the export file to the production machine and with the RadiantOne services stopped (all except for ZooKeeper), from a cmd prompt, run the import command (assuming you saved the exported file to C:/tmp on the target production machine).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] ensure all RadiantOne services EXCEPT ZooKeeper are stopped on the target machine prior to importing. ZooKeeper servers in the ensemble must be running prior to importing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>C:\\r1\\migration\\radiantone-migration-tool-2.1.0\\migrate.bat import C:\\tmp\\export.zip cross-environment</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">C:\\r1\\migration\\radiantone-migration-tool-2.1.0\\migrate.bat import C:\\tmp\\export.zip cross-environment</code></pre></div>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<p>After the import, start the needed RadiantOne services on the new machine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Development/QA machine remove the lock on configuration changes.

Typically, the backend data sources in a development/QA environment are different servers than are in the production environment. Therefore, the connection strings need to be changed as you migrate to production.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] one purpose of having a data source defining the connection is to isolate the connection string from the metadata files (.dvx and .orx). It is strongly recommended that you use generic data source names that can remain (be relevant) as you migrate from a development to production environment where you only need to change the connection information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Data sources can be edited from the Main Control Panel or from the command line using the vdsconfig utility. Using the Main Control Panel is described below. For information on using the vdsconfig utility, please see the RadiantOne Command Line Configuration Guide.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Control Panel</strong></p>\n<p>Data sources can be edited from the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Server Backend section.

However, this logic is executed inside the RadiantOne process, so caution should be taken to ensure no undesirable affects. It is highly recommended that if you choose to write your own interception logic that you get it approved by Radiant Logic prior to deploying it in production.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-the-java-virtual-memory-size-for-the-radiantone-service\">Setting the Java Virtual Memory Size for the RadiantOne Service</h2>\n<p>Often, the memory requirements of the RadiantOne service are larger in production environments than for Development/QA environments. If this is the case, you can increase the memory size. By default, the memory allocated to the RadiantOne JVM process expands up to ¼ of the machine memory. For example, if the machine memory is 16 GB, then the JVM process expands to up to 4 GB. Once the memory requirements are known for your deployment, ensure the minimum and maximum memory allocations are the same to prevent the heavy process of heap resizing at runtime. To define a minimum and maximum JVM heap memory size, you can define it with the -Xms and -Xmx settings as described below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] It is recommended to keep the maximum memory (-Xmx) under 32 GB to ensure the JVM uses compressed OOPs as a performance enhancement. If this is exceeded, the pointers switch to ordinary object pointers which grow in size, are more CPU-intensive and less efficient. Also, -Xms and -Xmx should be set to the same value to help avoid the performance-costly process of garbage collection from happening too frequently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]For RadiantOne deployments involving only Universal Directory stores, you can set maximum memory limits to leave more machine memory available for the store. A -Xmx of 2 GB allocated to the RadiantOne process is often enough to support a Universal Directory store containing 10 million entries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Windows Platforms</strong>\r\nIf you run the RadiantOne service as a Windows Service or from the Main Control Panel (Dashboard tab), increase the JVM size in the %RLI_HOME%/bin/VDSServer.config file. To define a minimum memory size, edit or insert a line containing the -Xms setting. The following example sets the minimum to 1 GB.</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>vmparam –Xms1024m</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">vmparam –Xms1024m</code></pre></div>\n<p>To define a maximum memory size, edit or insert a line containing the -Xmx setting. The following example sets the maximum to 2 GB.</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>vmparam –Xmx2048m</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">vmparam –Xmx2048m</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>On Linux Platforms</strong></p>\n<p>Edit the runVDSServer.sh file before running and change the -Xms and -Xmx settings. The following examples set the minimum and maximum to 2 GB.\r\n-Xms2048m\r\n-Xmx2048m</p>\n<h3 id=\"reconfiguring-persistent-cache\">Reconfiguring Persistent Cache</h3>\n<p>If you have decided to configure a persistent cache from your underlying data sources, you must reconfigure and reinitialize the cache in your production environment (or every time you move through environments where the data set is different). As you migrate your files to production, the data stored in the persistent cache may become irrelevant because the information stored in the cache is development/QA data (which may not be the same as production data).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] if you are using a persistent cache with periodic refresh, you do not need to reconfigure the periodic refresh in the target environment. Only a reinitialization of the data is needed in the target environment. If you are using a persistent cache with real-time refresh, you need to reconfigure and reinitialize the data in the target environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To configure a persistent cache:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the Main Control Panel -> Directory Namespace tab, click the cache node and select the branch to configure as persistent cache. Complete the steps to configure the branch as cache.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expand below the Cache node and click the persistent cache branch you want to initialize.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Refresh Settings tab, configure the refresh type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the Initialize button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose to either initialize the cache by creating an LDIF file or from an existing LDIF file. Typically, you would always use the default option which is to create an LDIF file. The only time you will choose to use an existing file is if you already have an up to date LDIF file containing all of the needed entries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click OK. A task is launched to initialize the persistent cache. The task can be monitored and managed from the Server Control Panel > Tasks tab (of the RadiantOne leader node).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After initializing, click <strong>Save</strong> in the upper right corner and click <strong>OK</strong> to apply the changes to the server.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 13.333333333333334%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/10fe615e7fb12189c901d6d7af2bad0e/a3695/Image7.11.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/10fe615e7fb12189c901d6d7af2bad0e/bf173/Image7.11.jpg 375w,\n/static/10fe615e7fb12189c901d6d7af2bad0e/a3695/Image7.11.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 7.11: Initializing Persistent Cache</p>\n<p>If you are initializing large numbers of entries, the memory required to process this task increases.

Although there are many different aspects of RadiantOne that can be monitored, memory and disk space are two of the most important. Monitoring can also be extremely helpful in determining how to properly tune your RadiantOne environment. For example, paying close attention to how disk space and memory are growing during the first week of deployment in production can help to put in place the right archiving and memory allocations.</p>\n<p>For details on monitoring, please see the RadiantOne Monitoring and Reporting Guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optional-configuring-inter-cluster-replication\">(Optional) Configuring Inter-Cluster Replication</h3>\n<p>If you have multiple data centers/sites in production, configure inter-cluster replication for all needed Universal Directory stores and/or persistent caches.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optional-performing-upload-in-global-identity-builder\">(Optional) Performing Upload in Global Identity Builder</h3>\n<p>If the Global Identity Builder was used in the Dev/QA environment, perform an upload of identities into the global profile and configure persistent cache in the production environment. See the RadiantOne Global Identity Builder Guide for steps to upload identities and configure persistent cache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optional-enabling-fips-mode\">(Optional) Enabling FIPS Mode</h3>\n<p>FIPS Mode settings are not migrated with the migration utility. To enable FIPS Mode in production, see the RadiantOne FIPS Mode Guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optional-configuring-instance-subclusters-of-radiantone\">(Optional) Configuring Instance Subclusters of RadiantOne</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] As of RadiantOne v7.4.2, instances are no longer created and deleted via the Main Control Panel. Instead, they are now installed and uninstalled using the RadiantOne Instance Manager utility. For details on installing Instances, see the RadiantOne Installation Guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>RadiantOne instance subclusters are used to address a very small set of use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne virtualizing (by proxy) two different directory backends that contain the exact same root naming context (but different hierarchies). With a proxy virtualization approach, a single root naming context in RadiantOne can only connect to one backend directory (mounted at the root), and you can’t have the same root naming context represent two different virtual views.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RadiantOne must enforce different global properties (e.g. require mutual authentication) per client application.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"managing-radiantone-instances\">Managing RadiantOne Instances</h4>\n<p>Instances of RadiantOne can be managed from the Main Control Panel or the Instance Manager command line utility. Both options are described in this section. For information on installing RadiantOne instance subclusters, refer to the Installation Guide.</p>\n<h5 id=\"radiantone-main-control-panel\">RadiantOne Main Control Panel</h5>\n<p>The Main Control Panel  Clusters tab allows you to view subclusters.</p>\n<p>Once a new instance subcluster is defined, you can click on the Open link to launch the Control Panel for that instance.

Load balancing is best deployed across multiple nodes within the same site/data center.</p>\n<p>In any event, to address scenarios like this, a push replication mode is available to directly send the changes to intended targets. The targets must be other RadiantOne servers defined as LDAP data sources. The LDAP data source definition could represent all nodes in the target cluster by indicating one as the primary and the rest of the nodes as failover, or it could point to a load balancer which in turn is configured to distribute requests across the cluster nodes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] Push Replication is an advanced setting. Consult with a Radiant Logic Solution Architect to get assistance on the needed architecture and configuration. Push replication should not be enabled on all clusters. Generally, push replication should only be enabled on the cluster that hosts the replication journal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pushing replication events can make the changes available in other data centers faster than waiting for the publish/subscribe method. There are two modes to push events: default and ensured push mode. The default push mode is a broadcast of the changes to the configured targets. There is no waiting for acknowledgement that the targets can be reached prior to returning the modify response to the client. The server that receives the write operation pushes the change to all configured targets, updates its local store, writes the change to the replication journal and responds to the client with a modify response. With the ensured push mode, the server sends the changes to the configured targets and waits for an acknowledgement about whether the target(s) could be reached or not. Enabling this mode provides a certain level of assurance that the target(s) have received the changes without any guarantee that they were actually able to update their replica. However, this can reduce the throughput of the RadiantOne service because it does not respond to the client’s modify request until it gets an acknowledgment from all configured targets. If a target server is not responding with an acknowledgement, the “Write Operation Timeout” configured for LDAP connection pooling can indicate that RadiantOne should skip that target, update its own image, publish the change to the replication journal and send a modify response back to the client.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] The intended targets receive the changes from the replication journal whether the changes were successfully replicated with push mode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"persistent-cache-configuration\">Persistent Cache Configuration</h3>\n<p>Persistent caches and Universal Directory stores both use the same underlying data storage layer. The biggest difference is that the data in a persistent cache view is a customized copy of data coming from any number of authoritative backends and it has a built-in refresh mechanism. This means, when data changes in the authoritative sources, the data in the persistent cache view is refreshed automatically. Universal Directory data doesn’t have this notion of dependent backends and automatic refresh.</p>\n<h4 id=\"backends-accessible-by-all-sites\">Backends Accessible by All Sites</h4>\n<p>If each site (e.g. data center) has access to the backend data sources (either directly or a replica), the recommended approach is to have each data center/cluster be responsible for its own persistent cache refreshes. The data sources (backends) themselves must be configured for replication (depicted by the purple line in the diagram below). The leader node in each cluster is responsible for handling the cache refresh (depicted by the green line in the diagram below). Other respective cluster nodes receive changes via block replication (depicted by the black-dashed line in the diagram below).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 513px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 42.66666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/3658d31a2015543ea6bd143960c68afc/3047a/Image7.21.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3658d31a2015543ea6bd143960c68afc/bf173/Image7.21.jpg 375w,\n/static/3658d31a2015543ea6bd143960c68afc/3047a/Image7.21.jpg 513w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 7.21: Persistent Cache Configuration for Multi-Cluster/Data Center Deployments</p>\n<h5 id=\"configuration-1\">Configuration</h5>\n<p>Perform the following steps on each cluster.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>On the RadiantOne cluster leader node, go to the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the cache node and select the branch to configure as persistent cache.

This node publishes the changes to the persistent cache into a replication journal. The leader nodes in the other clusters are responsible for periodically checking the journal for changes that they need to apply locally. Should conflicting change events occur, a combination of timestamps and sequence numbers associated with the conflicting events are used to resolve the conflict.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] on startup, a RadiantOne leader node first applies any missed change events from the replication journal and only after these changes have been applied will it be able to serve as an active node in the cluster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A data source named replicationjournal is included in the RadiantOne install and plays the role of the journal. This data source points to the default cn=replicationjournal store installed with RadiantOne and should not be deleted or deactivated. You can decide to have the journal running on one of the clusters that is participating in replication, or run a separate cluster whose only role is to house the journal. Having the journal housed in an Universal Directory store deployed in a cluster ensures high availability of this repository. The replicationjournal data source should indicate a primary server/node in the cluster and the failover servers should point to the other cluster nodes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 417px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 38.666666666666664%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/c83e9c12d8710139d3121f55c1f17a98/6eca5/Image7.23.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c83e9c12d8710139d3121f55c1f17a98/bf173/Image7.23.jpg 375w,\n/static/c83e9c12d8710139d3121f55c1f17a98/6eca5/Image7.23.jpg 417w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 7.23: The Journal Leveraged for Inter-cluster Replication</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] You do not need to use the default cn=replicationjournal store installed with RadiantOne as the journal.

Inter-cluster replication relies on the names to identify replication events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning]Also, it is recommended to NOT start the persistent cache refresh process on the primary cluster until you have the Universal Directory stores in the new cluster(s) properly setup (as exact replicas of the persistent cache). This ensures the stores will have the current image of the persistent cache from the primary cluster initially and no changes are logged into the replication journal yet for this “domain” (naming context).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Designate one data center as the primary/main. At this site, define the virtual views, persistent cache and desired refresh.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!warning] Make sure the port used by RadiantOne that houses the replication journal (2389 by default) can be accessed from all clusters and that firewall rules do not prevent the cluster from reading and writing into the journal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Install the first cluster node at the new data center. Be sure the name of the cluster you create at this site is different than the cluster name used in the primary site/data center.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab of the first cluster node, define a root naming context of type Universal Directory (HDAP) store and name it the same as the persistent cache naming context in the primary/main cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the primary/main data center, export the store/cache from the Main Control Panel > Directory Namespace tab. Make sure the option “Export for Replication” is selected (to ensure the UUID attribute is properly handled).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Copy the exported LDIF file from the primary data center and use it to initialize the Universal Directory store in the target data center.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the first cluster node in the target data center is initialized with the LDIF file from the primary cluster, install additional RadiantOne nodes on the new site and have them join this new cluster.

Generally, a cluster that is handling client requests should have between 2-5 nodes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On any cluster node of the new site(s), edit the replicationjournal data source to point site/cluster that is hosting the replication journal. This can be done from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Server Backend section > LDAP Data Sources sub-section. Click on the replicationjournal data source and click <strong>Edit</strong>. Modify the hostname and port to point to the load balancer that sits in front of the nodes that host the replicationjournal. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On any cluster node of the new site(s), configure the Universal Directory stores to support Inter-cluster Replication. This is a single-writer replication model from the primary cluster to this new site.

Enter the hostname and port that point to the load balancer that sits in front of the nodes of the cluster at this site.

Therefore, you must redirect bind operations to the primary/main (cache refresh) site, which will redirect the credentials to the backend(s) accordingly. On the leader node of (each) new replica site, go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Interception section > Redirections sub-section (requires <a href=\"00-preface#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>).

In the “Redirect Bind Operations to” drop-down list, select the data source that represents the RadiantOne nodes in the primary (cache refresh) site (use the VDSLBCache data source that was defined in step 11 above). If you do not have a data source configured that points to the RadiantOne nodes in the primary site, go to the Server Backend section, LDAP Data Sources sub-section and create one that points to the load balancer configured in front of the nodes at the primary/cache refresh site. Then go back to the Interception section, Redirections sub-section and define that all Binds be redirected to the data source associated with the primary site.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 146px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 49.31506849315069%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An image showing \"\n        title=\"An image showing \"\n        src=\"/static/66b8bf2e925a9cbc9ac5d41aba4e1e8f/0b81d/Image7.24.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/66b8bf2e925a9cbc9ac5d41aba4e1e8f/0b81d/Image7.24.jpg 146w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Figure 7.24: Option to Redirect Binds to the Cache Refresh Site</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] if the ‘<a href=\"02-tuning-tips-for-caching-in-radiantone#use-cache-for-authentication\">Use Cache for Authentication</a>’ option is enabled for the persistent cache in the primary (cache refresh) site, the passwords are stored in the cache and authentication is handled locally by RadiantOne as opposed to being delegated to the backend.

On the RadiantOne leader node of the replica site(s), go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Interception section -> Redirections sub-section (requires <a href=\"00-preface#expert-mode\">Expert Mode</a>). Select the naming context representing the Universal Directory store and click <strong>Edit</strong>.

This offers an option to write the change locally in addition to redirecting it to the primary site/cluster allowing for the change to be reflected faster on the site that received the change as opposed to waiting for it to be reflected in/picked up from the replication journal. The options for local writes are as follows:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Write locally after reading from redirected source (default behavior)</strong></p>\n<p>The write request is redirected and if it is successful the local store is written to after reading from the remote source.</p>\n<p><strong>No local write</strong></p>\n<p>The write request is redirected to the remote data source. There is no immediate update made to the local store.</p>\n<p><strong>Write locally based on the request</strong></p>\n<p>The write request is redirected and if it is successful the local store is written to immediately.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!note] In all cases, the local entry is updated (later) through inter-cluster replication when the leader node picks up the changes from the replication journal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>(Optional) If the new replica site(s) must be able to accept write operations from clients, and you require a more real-time replication mode where changes are pushed directly to intended targets, click on the “Configure Push Mode” button and select the data sources representing the intended RadiantOne targets.

The server that receives the write operation pushes the change to all configured targets, updates its local store, writes the change to the replication journal and responds to the client with a modify response.

However, this can reduce the throughput of the RadiantOne service because it does not respond to the client’s modify request until it gets an acknowledgment from all configured targets.
